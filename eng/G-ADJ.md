# Adjectives

An adjective is a word that adds some quality or description to another word,
for example *good*, *bad*, *big*, and *fast*.

## Modifying nouns

In Pandunia, adjectives are usually placed before the noun that they modify.

*novi gar*
– new car(s)  
*rapi gar*
– fast car(s)  
*dayi mez*
– big table(s)  
*gavi mez*
– high table(s)  
*boni kurse*
– good chair(s)

Two or more adjectives can modify the same noun.

*leti novi gar*
– a little, new car

## Predicative use

Adjective can be also after the noun.
Often this type of phrases can be read as complete sentences, where the verb *to be* is implied.

*gar novi.*
– The car is new.  
*bagre rapidi.*
– The tiger is fast.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

*novi gar rapidi.*
– The new car is fast.
