## What is Pandunia?

Pandunia is a little constructed language.
It is here to help people who speak different languages to talk together.
It is a globally sourced language
that brings together words from all over the world.
It has a simple structure and very little grammar.

Pandunia is a helping language for world-wide use.
It is an easy language that people can use to talk with each other
when they don't talk any other common language.
It is meant to supplement other languages in our multilingual world.

Pandunia is simpler, more regular and easier to learn than natural world languages,
like English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Arabic and Hindi.
Learning Pandunia is equally easy for everybody!
Its words have been borrowed from all continents and from all cultures of the world.

The final version of Pandunia will be published in 2023.
