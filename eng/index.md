## Learn it now!

Pandunia is written in the Latin (and English!) alphabet:  
A B C Ch D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S Sh T U V X Y Z

Only one letter is pronounced different than what is normal in English:
**c** = ts as in _cats_.

All vowels are pure vowels.
The letter **e** may be pronounced as the central vowel /ə/ in unaccented syllables.

The spelling of Pandunia is nearly phonetic.
One sound = one letter.

The stressed syllable is the first one in short words and the second one in longer words.  
**méni pérson kén tólke da Énglish in Amérika.**
– Many people can speak English in America.

Words stay always the same in Pandunia.
There aren't any special _inflected_ forms for cases, tenses, moods, singular and plural etc.

The normal word order is subject–verb–object
so the doer comes first, then the action word and finally the object of the action.  
**mi love yu.**
– I love you.
