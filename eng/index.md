## What is Pandunia?

Pandunia is a **multicultural constructed language** that is spoken by a small number of people currently.
It is **not** an international auxiliary language – yet! –
because there are not enough speakers to qualify it as one.

Pandunia can be used for:

-   getting to know multicultural international words
-   learning scientific vocabulary
-   talking with a small group of like-minded people
-   challenging your mind
-   creating art, like poetry and music
-   fun and personal things, like keeping a diary
-   dreaming of a better world, where all people are equal

All words in Pandunia are international in some part of the world.
They come from widely spoken languages,
including English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi and Swahili,
only to mention a few.

Pandunia is regular and simple.
Therefore it can be learned much easier and faster than English and other national languages.
There aren't any grammatical exceptions or complex rules in Pandunia.
Pandunia is so simple that its basic grammar can be described in [only ten rules](G-baze.md).
Everybody can learn Pandunia to a good level in a short period of time!
Pandunia would be an excellent choice for the global second language
because it could improve the quality of international communication.


## Overview of Pandunia's structure

Pandunia is written in the Latin (and English!) alphabet:  
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V X Y Z

All letters are pronounced roughly in the same way as in English.

All vowels are pure vowels.
They are pronounced as in
<i><u>a</u>re th<u>e</u>re thr<u>ee</u> <u>o</u>r tw<u>o</u></i>.

The spelling of Pandunia is nearly phonetic.
One sound = one letter or a pair of letters.

The stress is on that syllable that is before the last consonant of the root word.
Prefixes and suffixes are either unstressed or they may carry a secondary stress.  
*múlti hóm póta básha pandúnia.*
– Many people can speak Pandunia.

Words stay always the same in Pandunia.
There aren't any special _inflected_ forms for cases, tenses, moods, singular and plural etc.

The normal word order is subject–verb–object
so the doer comes first, then the action word and finally the object of the action.
