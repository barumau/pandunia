## Learn it now!

Pandunia is written in the Latin (and English!) alphabet:  
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U V X Y Z

Only two letters are pronounced differently than normally in English:
**c** = *ch* as in *church*, and
**x** = *sh* as in *ship*.

All vowels are pure vowels.
They are pronounced as in
<i><u>a</u>re th<u>e</u>re thr<u>ee</u> <u>o</u>r tw<u>o</u></i>.

The spelling of Pandunia is nearly phonetic.
One sound = one letter.

The stress is on that syllable that is before the last consonant of the root word.
Prefixes and suffixes are either unstressed or they may carry a secondary stress.  
**múlti hóm kán báxe pandúnia.**
– Many people can speak Pandunia.

Words stay always the same in Pandunia.
There aren't any special _inflected_ forms for cases, tenses, moods, singular and plural etc.

The normal word order is subject–verb–object
so the doer comes first, then the action word and finally the object of the action.
