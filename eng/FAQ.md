#### When was Pandunia created?

Pandunia has been created over many years.
The creator of the language, Risto Kupsala,
had his first ideas about an evenly global auxiliary language in the early 2000s.
He experimented different ideas together with other people.
Pandunia started to take form in 2017.
The final version of the language was published in 2024
– but of course languages evolve all the time!

#### What does the flag of Pandunia represent?

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/bandera.png "The flag of Pandunia")

The flag of Pandunia represents global equality.
There is a symbol of _the blue planet_ against the background of the dark blue galaxy.
The equality sign is laid over the Earth to symbolize global equality.

#### What is the symbol of Pandunia?

The symbol of Pandunia is the circled equals sign, which is also in the flag.
It is easy to draw by hand.
In computers, there is a dedicated circled equals symbol: `⊜`.
Its Unicode code is U+229C, but unfortunately it's not visible with all fonts.
It can be written easily in the smiley-style: `(=)` or `(＝)`.

#### Where do Pandunia words come from?

Pandunia's words come from all parts of the world.
Read the [article about world words](L-lexe.md) for more details,
and see the
[Pandunia lexe na dunia karta](http://www.pandunia.info/lexekarte/index.html)
pages to see where every Pandunia word is from on a world map.

In our opinion the world language should be a mix of all languages in the world.
That's why Pandunia has at least a few words in common with almost all languages of the world,
because every language has borrowed at least some international words from the major languages
from where Pandunia words are borrowed too.


#### Why Pandunia doesn't take words from all languages?

The vocabulary of Pandunia is borrowed from 21 most widely-spoken languages in the world.
They cover all continents and all major modern cultures.
All other languages probably have some _international words_ in common with the 21 main source languages.
That's why Pandunia-like words can be found also in less widely spoken languages.

About 6000–7000 languages are spoken in the world today.
It wouldn't make sense to borrow one word from each language.
Knowing just one word in the world language would be nearly useless.
People need to know about 1000–3000 words in the new language to communicate effectively.
However, the number of words is less than the number of languages in the world.

It is wise to focus on languages that most people know
as their native language or as a learned language.
The figure below shows cumulative distribution of the number of speakers of the 50 most spoken native languages.
The figure shows that:

- 25 percent of all people speak the top-3 languages
- 50 percent of all people speak the top-13 languages
- 75 percent of all people speak the top-50 languages

The remaining languages – remember, there are over 6000 of them! – are outside the picture.
The curve, which is steep at the beginning, turns virtually into a flat line when it approaches the last language,
which is spoken by only a handful of people.

Figure. Percentage of world population by language by number of native speakers.

The figure indicates that _beyond a certain point_
including one more language to the mix wouldn't make the interlanguage significantly more international.
For example, if the top-50 languages were already included,
adding the 51st language wouldn't make much of a difference,
because it would increase the coverage from 75.07% to 75.43%.

One can also question the practical implications of including 51 languages versus 50.
The increase in population coverage would be marginal, only 0.36%,
and it would not help the remaining 24.24% of the world who speak other, less spoken languages!


#### Why the mascot of Pandunia is a duck-billed platypus?

Platypus (**batakrote** in Pandunia) is an egg-laying, duck-billed,
beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal that lives in eastern Australia.
It is an unusual creature. That's why the platypus is a fitting
mascot for Pandunia, which is also an unusual mix, a mix of words and
grammar from East and West, from North and South.

Pandunia doesn't fit into any of the traditional types of languages.
Also in that regard it is similar to the platypus, which is of its own type.

## Past, present and future

#### I want to change something in Pandunia. What should I do?

If your change is a small thing, you should try it in practice with
other people and see how it works. If it really is a good change,
other people will accept it and use it.
It will become part of the language naturally.

Creating offshoot languages is very common in the auxiliary language circles.
The case of Esperanto is famous.
Offshoots of Esperanto are counted in the hundreds but most people haven't heard about any of them.
Esperanto is still the most popular language of its kind.

It is better to have one big language with several dialects than many competing languages.

#### Which languages have influenced the grammar of Pandunia?

Pandunia has been influenced by both natural and constructed
languages.

- Natural languages with isolating grammar were a useful model. For
  example the pivot structure comes directly from Chinese.
- Works of earlier language makers were inspirational.
    - Esperanto, Ido, Novial etc. were closely examined.
    - Latino sine Flexione, Lingua Sistemfrater and Interglossa all
      have well thought-out isolating grammars.
- Natural contact languages (so called _pidgins_ and _creoles_) gave many ideas.
  It is an interesting observation that when speakers of different languages come into contact,
  they tend to create extremely simplified grammar to overcome the language barrier
  — no matter how complex languages they speak natively.

The "family tree" of Pandunia is presented in the figure below.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/familytree.gif "The family tree of Pandunia")



#### Who made Pandunia?

The starter of Pandunia is _Risto Kupsala_ (born in Finland in 1979).
He is a computer scientist (M.Sc.) and a linguist (M.A.)
who wants to help the world communicate better.
People from many countries have helped over the years to develop the language.
There is a list of some of the contributors in
[GitHub](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/graphs/contributors).



## Auxiliary language

#### What is a worldlang?

A worldlang is a constructed interlanguage that borrows its words,
speech sounds and possibly grammar from different language families
of the world. There are many worldlangs. Some of them are listed
[here](http://www.kupsala.net/risto/tekokieli/worldlangs.html).

#### How does Pandunia differ from other auxiliary languages?

- The vocabulary of Pandunia is evenly global.
  It consists of Euro-American, Afro-Asian, South Asian and East Asian words.
  Many other auxiliary languages use only or mostly Euro-American words,
  which is not ideal for the world language in our opinion.
- Internationality is the main criterion for selecting words to Pandunia.
  All Pandunia words are widely known in some part of the world.
- The grammar of Pandunia is concise but very flexible.
  Pandunia has only a few grammatical structures, which are re-used over and over again.
- Pandunia is a truly neutral language.
  It's not meant to imitate any languages,
  whereas for example Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua
  are intentionally similar to the European languages.

#### Did Esperanto contribute to the birth of Pandunia?

At first Esperanto was an important source of inspiration.
However the influence of Esperanto to the final language is insignificant.
Pandunia has very different structure and vocabulary compared to Esperanto.

#### Are the makers of Pandunia aware of the history of the IAL movement?

Yes. Here are some of the most important lessons to be learned from
the history of the international auxiliary language (IAL) movement.

- Over 99% of IALs do not survive in the long term.
- Languages that are created without any pre-existing model (so
  called _a priori_ languages) have very low chance of survival.
- Languages that imitate and simplify one or more natural languages
  have some chance of survival.
- Out of a group of many similar languages only one is likely to do
  well.
- Success can be short-lived. (Remember Volapük and Ido.)
- Rational reasons do not explain success. The "best" language
  doesn't necessarily win.
- Large international organizations, such as the UN or the EU, pay
  very little attention to IALs. So it is up to grassroots movements
  to push an IAL to success.

#### Isn't it easier to just speak English instead?

English is indeed widely used
– even up to a degree that some would like to call it _the_ international language.
However, that is not quite true.
Only about 6% of the world's population are native English speakers, and 75% of people don't speak English at all.

Unfortunately, English is not very good at being an international language.
It's not its own fault.
It just happens to be the case that natural languages,
including English, French, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin Chinese and most others,
are the products of very long, natural, undirected language evolution.
How things are said and written in these languages is more because of convention and tradition
than because of beauty, logic, simplicity and practicality.

There is also the viewpoint of fairness.
International communication should be fair, like a meeting where everybody get together half-way.
That's not the situation with English.
Native English speakers don't need to make any effort in learning the international language,
while everybody else has to spend years learning English in school or on their own.
Native English speakers are in a dominant position that they have gained just by their birth.
That's not fair.

This is mostly a result of political history.
Britain was once successful at invading and submitting other territories in the age of colonialism
and it imposed the English language on other peoples.
Although the power of Britain waned eventually,
its military, economic and cultural dominance was continued by another English speaking power, the United States, until today.

Native English speakers always have an advantage over non-native speakers
because they speak English fluently and they are aware of all the cultural nuances.
Native English speakers speak English perfecty by definition,
whereas non-native speakers speak it almost always with an accent
– and it's their job to lose that accent!
They also tend to make mistakes in grammar
and they often select their words poorly
because English vocabulary is huge, layered, and nuanced.

The table below summarizes the main points of difference between
English (a natural language)
and Pandunia (a constructed helping language).

#### Should Pandunia replace English then?

Pandunia is not meant to replace English or any other languages.
People have ability to speak several languages and they speak every
language for a different reason. Some people speak one language at
home, another at work and yet another on international travels. We
can imagine a world where English and all other languages will
continue to be spoken, and where Pandunia is spoken as the universal
second language.

In a way, English will never be replaced. Those who speak it today
will speak it tomorrow. But new generations will grow and they will
choose which language(s) they want to speak with each other. So it
will be _another world_ with another world language. Maybe it will be
English, or maybe a new kind of English or maybe something else. The
landscape of languages changes in a natural process. Different
languages were spoken in the past and different languages will be
spoken in the future.

You are free to speak Pandunia, English and any other language that
your heart desires.


## Spelling and pronunciation

#### Is the spelling of Pandunia normal?

Pandunia assigns letters to sounds in an almost universal way.
Most letters correspond to roughly the same in Pandunia and in other languages
that use the Latin alphabet in their spelling or as their standard method of Romanization.
For example, 19 letters correspond to the same sounds in Pandunia and English
and only five are used differently.
In addition, two English letters (*w* and *q*) are not used in Pandunia.

The pronunciation of Pandunia letters is compared to their pronunciation in other languages in the table below.

- Letters that correspond to approximately similar sounds in Pandunia and the compared language are listed in the column "Similar".
  For example the English *g* is considered similar to the Pandunia *g*
  though in English there is the 'soft g' (as in _gel_) besides the more common 'hard g' (as in _get_).
- Letters that correspond usually to different sounds in Pandunia
  and in the compared language are listed in the column "Different".
- Pandunia letters that are not used in the compared language are listed in the column "Not used".

| Language         | Similar                                             | Different   | Not used|

In summary, most letters correspond to the same sounds in Pandunia as in other languages,
and most differences are about letters *c*, *j*, *sh*, *y* and *z*.


## Vocabulary


#### Why the last vowel of words is sometimes different in Pandunia than in language X?

The main reason is that Pandunia borrows words from many languages,
and often those languages don't agree about the final vowel.
For example the word **supa** ('soup') ends in -a in Spanish _sopa_,
in -u in Japanese スープ (_sūpu_),
in -e in German _Suppe_,
and not in any vowel in English _soup_.
So it's not one and the same word but rather an international family of similar words,
and Pandunia's **supa** fits perfectly into that family.


## Grammar

#### How Pandunia compares to pidgins and creoles?

Pidgins and creoles are _natural_ contact languages.
Pandunia is a _constructed_ contact language.
So the answer is no, Pandunia is not a real pidgin or a creole.
However, it is characterized by many of the same features as pidgins and creoles.

The following is a list of characteristic features of pidgins and creoles
that apply for Pandunia too.

1. Lack of grammatical complexity
   - No definite or indefinite article
   - Omission of the copula 'be'
   - Tense, aspect, modality and negation are not part of the verb.
   - Passive structures are not used.
2. Lack of morphological complexity
   - Nouns and pronouns are not inflected
   - Verbs are not inflected and tense is marked by separate words
3. Semantic transparency
   - Meaning of a word can be determined from the meanings of the parts of which the word is built.
4. Reduced vocabulary
   - Multifunctional words
   - All-purpose prepositions
5. Simple phonology
   - Avoid difficult sounds.
   - Use mostly simple syllable structures.
   - Prefer short words.
   - Tone is not used to distinguish words.
