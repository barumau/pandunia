# The basic rules of Pandunia

These are the basic rules of the Pandunia language.
They are described in more detail later in this document.

1.  **World words**

    Pandunia is an evenly global language.
    International words are borrowed from all parts of the world to Pandunia.
    They are adapted to the pronunciation and orthography of Pandunia.
    One basic word is admitted and additional words are built from it according to rule 10.

2.  **Spelling and pronunciation**

    Spelling is simple and regular.
    Every word is pronounced exactly as it is written.
    Almost every letter and letter-combination indicates always the same sound.

3.  **Regular stress accent**

    Root words are stressed on the syllable that is before the last consonant of the word, f.ex.
    *háo* ('nice'), *dúnia* ('world'), *báshe* ('language'), *amén* ('amen').
    Derived words and compound words are stressed according to their components so that the main component carries the primary stress
    and other components may carry secondary stress, f.ex.
    *trabáshe* ('translate'), *dúnialìsme* ('globalism'), *bàshe skóle* ('language school').
    Primary accent is indicated here by an acute accent (*á*) and secondary accent by a grave accent (*à*).

4.  **Word class**

    Pandunia is an analytical language.
    It means that its words do not inflect or change their form because of grammar.
    Therefore the same word can function in different grammatical roles,
    for example as noun, verb, adjective or adverb,
    without any change in form.
    Word forms change only when the word's meaning changes.

    This consistent system is a key factor for Pandunia's grammatical simplicity
    as it allows for direct communication without formal grammatical errors.

7.  **Numerals**

    The cardinal numbers are:  
    0 *nil*, 1 *un*, 2 *du*, 3 *tri*, 4 *char*, 5 *pen*, 6 *luk*,
    7 *set*, 8 *bat*, 9 *nau*, 10 *des*.  
    Greater than ten:
    11 *des un*, 12 *des du*, 13 *des tri*,
    etc.  
    Tens:
    20 *du des*, 30 *tri des*, 40 *char des*,
    etc.

    etc.  
    Thousands:
    1000 *un kil*, 2000 *du kil*, 3000 *tri kil*,

    When a number is put after the noun, it becomes the corresponding ordinal number:

    *parte du*
    – part two, the second part

9.  **Adverbs**

    Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs and complete sentences.
    They come before the word that they modify or very last in the sentence.

    *tre rapid loge*
    – very fast speech  
    *tu rapid loge.*
    – You talk fast.

10. **Verbs**

    Pandunia verbs do not change in person, number, tense or any other grammatical category.
    Therefore a plain verb can be understood in many ways
    (though usually only one interpretation is fitting in the context of the discussion).

    *mi darse pandunia.*  
    'I study ~ studied ~ will study Pandunia.'

    Auxiliary verbs can be used to indicate the moment, duration and relevance of the action.

    -   *sta*
        indicates an ongoing event.
    -   *ha*
        indicates a completed event, which has an effect on the present situation.
    -   *le*
        indicates a past event.
    -   *fu*
        indicates a future event.

    *mi ha darse pandunia.*  
    'I have studied Pandunia.'

11. **Word order in clauses**

    The word order is subject–verb–object.
    The same order is used in declarations and questions.

    A passive sentence is created with the help of the passive auxiliary verb
    **bi**.

    *pandunia bi loge.*
    – Pandunia is spoken.   
    *bi loge pandunia.*
    – One speaks Pandunia.

    In the **pivot construction**, the object of the transitive verb functions as the subject of the following verb.

    *mi ples tu loge pandunia.*  
    'I ask you to speak Pandunia.'

    Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    
    *mi que tu bashe pandunia?* → *que tu bashe pandunia?*  
    'Do you speak Panlingue?'

    *me ples tu loge klar.* →  *ples loge klar.*  
    'Please speak clearly.'

12. **Word building**

    Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them by putting one element after another
    so that the main element stands at the end.

    *poste*
    ('mail') +
    *kase*
    ('box') =
    *postekase*
    ('mailbox')

    The linking vowel, *-o-*, can be inserted between the elements especially in compound words that stem from the Greek language.

    *dem*
    ('people') +
    *kratia*
    ('government, rule') =
    *demokratia*
    ('democracy, rule by the people')
