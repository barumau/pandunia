# 8. Verbs

Verbs are unchanging in Pandunia.
Things like person, number, time and mood are indicated by separate words,
not by changing the form of verbs as in English and other languages.

## Person and number

Person and number are indicated by the subject.
For example, the verb
**es**
('to be') has the same form in all persons.

**_mi_ es frende.**
– I am a friend.  
**_tu_ es frende.**
– You are a friend.  
**_ha_ es frende.**
– He/she is a friend.  
**_vi_ es frende.**
– We are friends.  
**_yu_ es frende.**
– You are friends.  
**_di_ es frende.**
– They are friends.

Also a noun can serve as subject.

**mau es hevan.**
– The cat is an animal.


## Time and mood

Verb tenses, moods and voices are expressed with auxiliary verbs,
which come first in the verb phrase.
The order of the auxiliaries is tense, mood and aspect.
The tense marker is first, the mood marker is next, and the aspect marker is last.

### Tense

Tense is a property that expresses time reference.
The main tenses are the past, present, and future.
The marker
**did**
indicates the past tense,
**nun**
indicates the present tense, and
**vil**
indicates the future tense.
More specific time references are expressed with various time expressions, like *yesterday*, *tomorrow* or *one hour ago*.

**man** ***did*** **yam ban.**
– The man *ate* (or *did eat*) bread.  
**man** ***nun*** **yam ban.**
– The man *eats* bread (now).  
**man** ***vil*** **yam ban.**
– The man *will eat* bread.

It is also possible to express the future in the past
with a combination of two tense markers.

**man** ***did vil*** **yam ban.**
– The man *was going to* eat bread.


### Aspect

Aspect expresses how an action or event extends over time.
There are two aspect markers in Pandunia,
**bi** and **hav**.

The marker
**bi**
indicates that the action or event is *on-going* or *in progress*
at the time, which the speaker is talking about.
The time can be indicated with a tense marker.

**man** ***bi*** **yam ban.**
– The man *is*, *was* or *will be* eating bread.  
**man** ***did bi*** **yam ban.**
– The man was eating bread.  
**man** ***nun bi*** **yam ban.**
– The man is eating bread.  
**man** ***vil bi*** **yam ban.**
– The man will be eating bread.

The marker
**hav**
indicates that the action or event is completed
and its results still has an effect at the time, which the speaker is talking about.
The time can be indicated with a tense markers.

**man** ***hav*** **yam ban.**
– The man *had*, *has* or *will have* eaten bread.  
**man** ***did hav*** **yam ban.**
– The man had eaten bread.  
**man** ***nun hav*** **yam ban.**
– The man has eaten bread.  
**man** ***vil hav*** **yam ban.**
– The man will have eaten bread.


### Mood

The conditional mood is used for anything that could take place.
It indicates that the realization of an action or event depends on another condition.
The conditional mood is expressed with the auxiliary verb
**vud**
('would').
This marker is used in both main and subordinate clauses.

**mi** ***vud*** **van yam.**
– I *would* like to eat.  
**mi** ***vud*** **go to Dubai.**
– I *would* go to Dubai.  
**mi** ***vud*** **go, if tu vud las mi.**
– I *would* go if you would let me.  
**tu no** ***vud*** **es suka, if mi** ***vud*** **go.**
– You would not be happy, if I would go.

The auxiliary verb
**shud**
('should, ought') indicates some kind of expectation like duty, obligation, requirement, desire, advisability or likelihood.

**ma voka vi. vi shud go.**
– Mother called us. We should go.  
**he shud hav kom pre nun.**
– He should have come by now.  
**evri von shud vote.**
– Everyone should vote.

The imperative mood is used to form a command or request.
In Pandunia, the imperative is created with the auxiliary verb
**shal**.
It can be used to give commands to any person, not just "you".

**vi shal go!**
– Let us go! ~ Let's go!  
**di shal kurse!**
– Let them run!

**shal**
can be used to give commands also to the second person,
but it is common to drop both the personal pronoun and the auxiliary verb
in order to give the command more force.

**tu shal kom!** = **kom!**
– Come!  
**yu shal kom!** = **kom!**
– Come (you all)!

## Transitivity

In general, there are three types of verbs.

1. Transitive verbs need a direct object, which is the target of the action.
2. Intransitive verbs don't accept an object. Then the action is directed to the subject.
3. Ambitransitive verbs can be both transitive and intransitive.

Pandunia verbs are typically ambitransitive
i.e. they may or may not require an object depending on the sentence structure.
When there is an object, the verb is transtive,
and when there isn't an object, the verb is intransitive.

**mi bule sui.**
– I boil water. (transitive sentence)  
**sui bule.**
– Water boils. (intransitive sentence)  
**baker bake ban.**
– The baker bakes bread. (transitive sentence)  
**ban bake in tanur.**
– Bread bakes in the oven. (intransitive sentence)


## Serial verb construction

Serial verb construction is a string of verbs that share the same subject,
which is before the verbs.
In serial verb constructions the verbs are interpreted so that
the first verb (an auxiliary verb) is something that the subject possesses
and the second verb is something that the subject does (when there is an object in the end)
or experiences (when there is no object).

**mi kan kitab de javab.**  
≈ *I have the ability to write the answer.*  
– I can write the answer.  
**mi halal kitab de javab.**  
≈ *I have the permission to write the answer.*  
– I may write the answer.  
**mi mus kitab de javab.**  
≈ *I have the compulsion to write the answer.*  
– I must write the answer.

Note that the same auxiliary verbs can be used alone as transitive verbs in the pivot construction.

**guru halal mi kitab de javab.**
– The teacher permits me to write the answer.  
**guru mus mi kitab de javab.**
– The teacher compels me to write the answer.
