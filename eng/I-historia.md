# History of Pandunia

## Before Pandunia

Ideas for Pandunia were formed in an inspiring environment.
Risto, the initiator of Pandunia, worked and exchanged ideas with other people
who were interested in constructed languages.
He participated in forums like
the [AUXLANG](https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=AUXLANG) mailing list
and the [Auxlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/auxlangs/) bulletin board in Reddit.

He exchanged ideas with
Florent Garet (creator of Luni),
Jens Wilkinson ([Neo Patwa](http://patwa.pbworks.com)),
Dana Nutter (Sasxsek),
Rex May ([Ceqli](http://ceqli.pbworks.com)),
Steve Rice ([Inlis](https://auxlanglab.blogspot.com)),
Dmitri Ivanov ([Lingwa de Planeta](http://www.lingwadeplaneta.info)),
Olivier Simon ([Sambahsa Mundialect](https://sambahsa.neocities.org/)),
Zeinelabidin Elhassi (Ardano),
Sonja Lang ([Toki Pona](https://tokipona.org/))
Arkadii Balandin,
and Justin Kunimune
only to mention a few.


## Years of development

In the early years, Pandunia was Risto's personal language project.
It was like play dough to him that could be shaped and reshaped again for experimenting new ideas.

He published the first sketch of Pandunia in 2007,
but it was only in 2012 that other people learned Pandunia for the first time.
Risto recorded a [short video in Pandunia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfkQrdyfLcQ) in 2013
to show what Pandunia sounded like then.

A few more people got interested about Pandunia in 2016,
and the Pandunia community started to grow slowly.
Pandunia got more known in 2017
when an article titled
["Pandunia, a global contact language"](https://dea.digar.ee/cgi-bin/dea?a=d&d=JVinterlinguisticatrt201705.2.5.2.4)
was published in the _Interlinguistica Tartuensis_ journal,
and a chapter is dedicated for Pandunia in the book *Keksittyjä kieliä* (in Finnish) by Kauko Kämäräinen.
One year later, Pandunia is mentioned in the
[Artificial Languages article](https://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11)
in the Oxford Research Encyclopedias.

## Digressions

Between 2019–2021 there was a digression in the evolution of Pandunia
that finally lead into a sibling language called [Panlingue](https://www.pandunia.info/panlingue/).
This branch used word-final vowels for marking word classes in the style of Esperanto.

Another digression occurred in 2024 with a more European-oriented branch of the language.
This alternative evolution of Pandunia finally became a separate language called [Panglo](https://www.pandunia.info/panglo/).
Panglo borrowed the most frequently occurring words from English and other Germanic languages
in an attempt to become a possible successor for international English
that was the most widely spoken international language at the time.

## Stabilization

The [second base version](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/releases/tag/v2.0) of Pandunia
was published in 2021.
It had simplified, inflectionless grammar and evenly global vocabulary.
The word derivation method in version 2 was isolating (so there was in principle only one morpheme per word).
Later this was changed to agglutinative style so that Pandunia could take advantage of prefixes and suffixes
that are common in international words of Greco-Latin and Perso-Arabic origin.
