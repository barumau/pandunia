# History of Pandunia

## Before Pandunia

Ideas for Pandunia were formed in an inspiring environment.
Risto, the initiator of Pandunia, worked and exchanged ideas with other people
who were interested in constructed languages.
He participated in forums like
the [AUXLANG](https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=AUXLANG) mailing list
and the [Auxlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/auxlangs/) bulletin board in Reddit.

He exchanged ideas with
Florent Garet (creator of Luni),
Jens Wilkinson ([Neo Patwa](http://patwa.pbworks.com)),
Dana Nutter (Sasxsek),
Rex May ([Ceqli](http://ceqli.pbworks.com)),
Steve Rice ([Inlis](https://auxlanglab.blogspot.com)),
Dmitri Ivanov ([Lingwa de Planeta](http://www.lingwadeplaneta.info)),
Olivier Simon ([Sambahsa Mundialect](https://sambahsa.neocities.org/)),
Zeinelabidin Elhassi (Ardano),
Sonja Lang ([Toki Pona](https://tokipona.org/))
Arkadii Balandin,
and Justin Kunimune
only to mention a few.


## Years of development

In the early years, Pandunia was Risto's personal language project.
It was like play dough to him that could be shaped and reshaped again for experimenting new ideas.

He published the first sketch of Pandunia in 2007,
but it was only in 2012 that other people learned Pandunia for the first time.
Risto recorded a [short video in Pandunia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfkQrdyfLcQ) in 2013
to show what Pandunia sounded like then.

A few more people got interested about Pandunia in 2016,
and the Pandunia community started to grow slowly.
Pandunia got more known in 2017
when an article titled
["Pandunia, a global contact language"](https://dea.digar.ee/cgi-bin/dea?a=d&d=JVinterlinguisticatrt201705.2.5.2.4)
was published in the _Interlinguistica Tartuensis_ journal,
and a chapter is dedicated for Pandunia in the book *Keksittyjä kieliä* (in Finnish) by Kauko Kämäräinen.
One year later, Pandunia is mentioned in the
[Artificial Languages article](https://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11)
in the Oxford Research Encyclopedias.

Risto recorded another [short video in Pandunia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgO8AwX4OCU)
in 2016 to show how the language had evolved.
Alex André recorded a [30 day challenge to learn Pandunia](https://twitter.com/XanderLeaDaren/status/1114972322157465612) in 2019.
This was called the [base version 1 of Pandunia](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/releases/tag/v1.1)
and it used word-final vowels for marking word classes in the style of Esperanto.
However, the language was still evolving, and the
[second base version](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/releases/tag/v2.1)
was published in 2021 and it didn't use the word-class markers anymore.

## Stabilization

The [third and final base version of Pandunia](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/releases/tag/v.3.0)
was published in early 2024.
It combined the best features of the previous versions:
word derivation system aligned to the international vocabularies and simplified, inflectionless grammar.
In addition the most frequently occurring words were replaced with those that are resemble English.
Pandunia had evolved from a creative constructed language into a serious successor for international English
that would level the playing field for international and multicultural communication.
