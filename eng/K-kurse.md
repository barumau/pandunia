<big>☺</big>
**sal!**
– Hello!  
<big>☻</big>
**salam!**
– Hello!  
<big>☺</big>
**tu sa que?**
– Who are you?  
<big>☻</big>
**me sa Yusef. tu sa que?**
– I am Yusef. Who are you?  
<big>☺</big>
**me sa Sara. ho sa que?**
– I am Sara. Who is that?  
<big>☻</big>
**ho sa me di doste.**
– That is my friend.  
<big>☺</big>
**ho di nim sa que?**
– What's her name?  
<big>☻</big>
**ho di nim sa Maria.**
– Her name is Maria.

### Grammar

Pandunia's sentences normally follow the topic-comment structure. 
The topic indicates who or what is being talked about. The comment
tells something about the topic. For instance in
**ho sa me di doste**
the topic is the pronoun
**ho**
('he, she, it'), which is followed by the comment
**sa me di doste**
('is my friend').

In Pandunia, the word
**sa**
functions like _to be_ in English.
The same word is used for all persons.
And to say the opposite, simply put
**no**
before it.

**ho sa Sara.**
— She is Sarah.  
**ho no sa Sara.**
— She is not Sarah.

**mau sa hevan.**
— The cat is an animal.  
**dom no sa hevan.**
— The house is not an animal.  

In the same way you can describe yourself by saying
**me sa**
and a word that describes you.

**me sa boni.**
— I'm good.  
**me sa man.**
— I'm a man.  
**me sa fem.**
— I'm a woman.  
**me sa exjeni.**
— I'm non-binary.

## Saying hello

**sal!**
— Hello!

This is how people often greet each other in Pandunia.
They say
**sal**.
It is used for saying both hello and goodbye.

**sal!**
— Bye!

The word
**sal**
means well-wishes and it is used as a greeting.

It has two origins.
On one hand, it comes from the Latin greeting *salve* and related greetings like French *salut*.
Also English *salute* and Spanish *saludo* are related to it.
On the other hand, it comes from a common Middle Eastern word for wishing well-being, health and safety.
It appears as *shlaam* in Aramaic, the language that Jesus of Nazareth spoke.
In Hebrew it is *shalom*,
and in Arabic it is *salaam*.
These words have been borrowed to many languages, so something like
**sal**
is already a common greeting in many countries in Africa, Asia and Europe.

Pandunia is a globalistic language
that borrows and blends together international words from all parts of the world.

The verb form of
**sal**
is
**sala**,
which means 'to wish well (for someone)' and 'to greet'.

**me sala tu.**
— I greet you.  
**tu sala me.**
— You greet me.

These are active sentences.
In active sentences the subject does the action to the object. In
**me sala tu**
the first word
**me**
is the subject,
**sala**
is the verb (action word), and
**tu**
is the object.
The order subject–verb–object (or SVO in short) is a normal word order in Pandunia.

> Word order in active sentence: Subject + Verb + Object

Pandunia's singular personal pronouns are:
**me**
'I',
**tu**
'you', and
**ho**
'he, she, it'.
Note that all the pronouns stayed the same in the previous example sentences.
Words never change in Pandunia.
Except for verbs, they always stay the same regardless of their position in sentence.

In Pandunia sentences can be made shorter by leaving out pronouns
that are obvious in the present situation.

**me sala tu!**
— I greet you.  
**sala tu!**
— Greetings to you! (It is obvious that the speaker is the one who greets.)  
**sala!**
— Greetings! (It is obvious that the listeners are greeted.)


You can use
**sal**
to address people by name, kinship term or profession.

**sal, Adam!**
— Hello, Adam!  
**sal, mama!**
— Hello, mother!  
**sal, papa!**
— Hello, father!  
**sal, shef!**
— Hello, chief!

## Making requests

### Dialog

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/laupapa.png "cin pa i bacha")  
<small>Image designed by [macrovector](https://www.freepik.com/macrovector)</small>

<big>☻</big>
**sal, senpa!**
— Hello, grandfather!  
<big>☺</big>
**sal! chinga sida.**
— Hello! Please sit!  
<big>☻</big>
**shukre.**
— Thank you.  
<big>☺</big>
**chinga yama kafe o cha.**
— Please have some coffee or tea.  
<big>☻</big>
**ama me uniko yama cha! shukre.**
— But I only drink tea! Thank you.  
...  
<big>☻</big>
**senpa, me debu chuta zayo.**
— Grandfather, I have to go now.  
<big>☺</big>
**oke. chinga sala tu di mama!**
— OK. Please tell greetings to your mother.  
<big>☻</big>
**me sala ho. sal reste!**
— I will. Bye!  
<big>☺</big>
**sal chute!**
— Bye!


### Grammar

Pandunia's singular personal pronouns are
**me**
'I',
**tu**
'you', and
**ho**
'he, she, it'.
Pandunia is a gender-neutral language.
It doesn't distinguish between sexes in the third person pronoun or any of the pronouns.
All the personal pronouns are present in the following example sentence.

**me chinga tu sala ho.**
— I ask you to say hello to him/her.

This sentence has a _pivot structure_.
The first verb,
**chinga**
('to ask, to beg'), addresses
**tu**
as its object. At the same time
**tu**
serves also as the subject of the second verb,
**sala**
('to greet'), whose object in turn is
**ho**.
So
**tu**
has a double role:
(1) object of the first verb and
(2) subject of the second verb.
Hence, it is the _pivot_ or hinge between the two verbs.

> Pivot construction: Subject + Verb¹ + Object/Subject + Verb² + Object

The pivot construction is a common structure in Pandunia.

Remember that it is allowed to leave out pronouns that are known in the context.
In other words the speaker can safely assume that the
listeners know who he or she is talking about.
So it is unnecessary to keep on repeating them.
In this manner phrases can be made shorter.

**me chinga tu sala ho.**
— I ask you to say hello to him/her.  
**chinga sala ho.**
— Please say hello to him/her.

See how the translation of
**chinga**
changed between the two sentences?
The meaning of the word, the concept, did not change, but its use did.
English reflects this change by using different words, to ask and please.
Pandunia can cope with changes like this without resorting to different words.
It is a principle in Pandunia that there is always exactly one word for one concept.
Different words are not created just because the grammatical role of a concept changes.

The phrase
**chinga sala ho**
has a useful pattern that can be used for making polite requests.

**chinga sida.**
— Please be seated.  
**chinga dona kafe.**
— Please give me some coffee.  
**chinga dona ch.**
— Please give me some tea.  
**chinga yama cha.**
— Please have some tea.  
**chinga safa kamre.**
— Please clean the room.

Commands are expressed more directly than requests.
A command is basically like the request but without the
**chinga**.

**dona cha!**
— Give (me) some tea!  
**safa kamre!**
— Clean the room!  
**safa ho!**
— Clean it!

### Asking questions

Questions that can be answered by saying _yes_ or _no_ have the same pivot structure as requests with
**chinga**,
which you learned in the previous lesson.
Question sentences are introduced with
**qua**
'to ask'.

**me qua tu yama cha.**
— I ask (do) you drink tea.  
**qua tu yama cha?**
— Do you drink tea?  
**qua yama cha?**
— Drink tea?

Requests usually concern the one or the ones spoken to, but questions
are often about other people. Therefore the second pronoun is usually
needed. It can be left out only when it is clear who is the topic of
discussion.

**qua ho yama cha?**
— Does he or she drink tea?  
**qua tu yama supe?**
— Do you eat soup?  
**qua memen yama sui?**
— Do we drink water?

Of course common and proper nouns can also be used.

**qua shef yama kafe?**
— Does the chief drink coffee?  
**qua papa safa kamre?**
— Does the father clean the room?  
**qua Adam basha pandunia?**
— Does Adam speak Pandunia?


### Giving answers

Yes/no questions can be answered with
**ya**
'yes', and
**no**
'no'.

**qua tu yama supe?**
— Do you eat soup?  
**ya.**
— Yes.

**qua ho yama supe?**
— Does she eat soup?  
**no.**
— No.

Also more complete answers can be given.

**qua tu yama kafe?**
— Do you drink coffee?  
**ya. me yama kafe.**
— Yes, I drink coffee.

**qua ho yama kafe?**
— Does he drink coffee?  
**no. ho no yama kafe.**
— No, he doesn't drink coffee.

It is also possible to answer yes by repeating the verb of the question.

– **qua tu yama sui?**
— Do you drink water?  
– **yama.**
— (Yes, I) drink.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saying no

In the previous lesson you learned to answer
**ya**
and
**no**
to questions. The word
**no**
is used for denying something. Adding
**no**
in front of the verb turns an affirmative sentence to negative.

**me sala tu.**
— I greet you.  
**me no sala tu.**
— I do not greet you.

Conceptually negation means the absence or non-existence of the negated word.
In the phrase
**me no sala tu**
the negative word
**no**
denies the existence of the greeting.

In Pandunia the negative word affects the word that follows it.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location
of the negative word.

**me chinga tu safa kamre.**
— I ask you to clean the room.  
**me no chinga tu safa kamre.**
— I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**me chinga tu no safa kamre.**
— I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The negated word can be of any type: verb, pronoun, noun, adjective
and even numeral.

**ho no tena mau.**
— She doesn't have a cat.  
**ho tena no mau, a gau.**
— She has no cats but dogs.  
**no ho, a me tena mau.**
— Not she but I have cats. (It's not her, but me who has cats.)  
**me tena no un, a du mau.**
— I have not one but two cats.


### Exercises

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## More Questions

To ask questions beginning with _what_, _which_, _how_, _who_ and _when_, the interrogative pronoun
**que**
is normally used.
The question can be made more specific by adding words for person, time, manner or thing if needed.

**ho sa que?**
— What is that? / Who is (s)he?  
**ho sa qui jan?**
— Who is he/she?  
**ho sa qui she?**
— What (thing) is it?  
**qui jan laya**
— Who is coming? (**jan** — person)  
**tu yama a qui zaman?**
— When do you eat? (**zaman** — time)  
**se dansa a qui mode?**
— How to dance? (**yang** — manner, style)

In Pandunia, questions beginning with _why_ are asked using
**qui sabab**.

**qui sabab tu suka mau?**
— Why do you like cats?

Questions asking about the cause or reason of something, are answered by adding
**de sabab**
before the cause or reason.

**qui sabab tu suku mau?**
— Why do you like cats?  
**de sabab homen sa kavai.**
— Because they are cute.

Of course,
**sabab**
can also be used to express the cause or reason for something,
even when not answering to a question.

**me suku mau de sabab homen sa kavai**
— I like cats because they are cute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Past, present and future

### Expressing time

There are no verb conjugations in Pandunia.
All verbs have only one form for all times.
In a way they are similar to some English verbs, such as *hit*, which is the same in all tenses.

**me bata ho.**
— I hit it.

In Pandunia all verbs are like that! For example,
**me yama ban**
can mean both "I eat bread" and "I ate bread",
but usually only one or the other meaning makes sense in the context of the discussion.
For example when people talk about that morning's breakfast, the sentence tells about the past time.

**me yama ban a ye suba yam.**
— I ate bread for this breakfast.

There are also specific time words.

**paso**
— in the past  
**zayo**
— currently, at the moment  
**vilo**
— later, in the future

They can be used for modifying nouns.

**Sara sa me di pasi shef.**
— Sarah is my former boss.  
**Yusef sa me di zayi shef.**
— Yusef is my current boss.  
**Maria sa me di vili shef.**
— Maria is my future boss.

The same words are used when you talk about actions and events in time.
Simply put the word before the verb.

**me paso bata ho.**
— I hit it (in the past).  
**me zayo bata ho.**
— I am hitting it (currently).  
**me vilo bata ho.**
— I will hit it (in the future).


It is not necessary to repeat the time expressions all the time.
It would be awkward.
It is enough to set the stage once in the beginning with a time expression.
Another time word will not be needed until the tense changes
or until it becomes useful to stress that you are still talking in the same tense.

**me paso tena un mau.**
— I had a cat in the past.  
**ho sa boni mau.**
— It was a good cat.  
**me zayo tena un gau.**
— I have a dog now.

Any expression of time is good for expressing the tense. When one
time expression is present, other markers are not needed.

**me genu a nen 2003.**
— I was born in 2003.  
**ho safa kamre a pos den.**
— He will clean the room tomorrow.
