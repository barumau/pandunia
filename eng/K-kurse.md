<big>☺</big>
**sal!**
– Hello!  
<big>☻</big>
**sal!**
– Hello!  
<big>☺</big>
**tu es ke?**
– Who are you?  
<big>☻</big>
**mi es Yusef. tu es ke?**
– I am Yusef. Who are you?  
<big>☺</big>
**mi es Sara. da es ke?**
– I am Sara. Who is that?  
<big>☻</big>
**da es mi su doste.**

<big>☺</big>
**da su nam es ke?**
– What's her name?  
<big>☻</big>
**da su nam es Maria.**
– Her name is Maria.

### Grammar

Pandunia's sentences normally follow the topic-comment structure. 
The topic indicates who or what is being talked about. The comment
tells something about the topic. For instance in
**da es mi su doste**
the topic is the pronoun
**da**
(he, she, it), which is followed by the comment
**es mi su doste**
(is my friend).

In Pandunia, the word
**es**
functions like _to be_ in English.
The same word is used for all persons.
And to say the opposite, simply put
**no**
before it.

**da es Sara.**
– She is Sarah.  
**da no es Sara.**
– She is not Sarah.

**mau es hevan.**
– The cat is an animal.  
**haus no es hevan.**
– The house is not an animal.  

In the same way you can describe yourself by saying
**mi es**
and a word that describes you.

**mi es bon.**
– I'm good.  
**mi es man.**
– I'm a man.  
**mi es fem.**
– I'm a woman.  
**mi es nobi.**
– I'm non-binary.

## Saying hello

**sal**
– Hello!

This is how people often greet each other in Pandunia.
They say
**sal**.
It is used for saying both hello and goodbye.

**sal**
– Bye!

The word
**sal**
means 'hello' or 'hi'.

It has two origins.
On one hand, it comes from the Latin greeting *salve* and related greetings like French *salut*.
Also English *salute* and Spanish *saludo* are related to it.
On the other hand, it comes from a common Middle Eastern word for wishing well-being, health and safety.
It appears as *shlaam* in Aramaic, the language that Jesus of Nazareth spoke.
In Hebrew it is *shalom*,
and in Arabic it is *salaam*.
So smething like
**sal**
is already a common greeting in hundreds of languages in Africa, Asia and Europe.

Pandunia is a constructed world language
that borrows and blends together international words from all parts of the world.

The word
**sal**
means *greeting* or *to greet*.

**mi sal tu.**
– I greet you.  
**tu sal mi.**
– You greet me.

These are active sentences.
In active sentences the subject does the action to the object. In
**mi sal tu**
the first word
**mi**
is the subject,
**sal**
is the verb (action word), and
**tu**
is the object.
The order of subject, verb and object is the normal word order
in Pandunia.

> Word order in active sentence: Subject + Verb + Object

Pandunia's singular personal pronouns are:
**mi**
'I',
**tu**
'you', and
**da**
'he, she, it'. Note that the pronouns stayed the same in the
previous example sentences. Words never change in Pandunia. They
always stay the same regardless of their position in sentence.

In Pandunia sentences can be made shorter by leaving out pronouns
that are obvious in the present situation.

**mi sal tu!**
– I greet you.  
**sal tu!**
– Greetings to you! (It is obvious that the speaker is the one who greets.)  
**sal!**
– Greeting! (It is obvious that the listeners are greeted.)  

Another Pandunia word for greeting is
**halo**.
It is also a very international greeting.
You can choose freely, which word to use when you greet people.

**halo!**
– Hello!

You may use both **sal** and **halo**
to address people by name, kinship term or profession.

**halo, toni!**
– Hello, Tony!  
**sal, mama!**
– Hello, mother!  
**halo, papa!**
– Hello, father!  
**sal, shef!**
– Hello, chief!

## Making requests

### Dialog

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/laupapa.png "cin pa i bacha")  
<small>Image designed by [macrovector](https://www.freepik.com/macrovector)</small>

<big>☻</big>
**halo, cin pa!**
– Hello, grandfather!  
<big>☺</big>
**sal! ples side.**
– Hello! Please sit!  
<big>☻</big>
**danke.**
– Thank you.  
<big>☺</big>
**ples yam kafe o cha.**
– Please have some coffee or tea.  
<big>☻</big>
**ama mi un li yam cha! danke.**
– But I only drink tea! Thank you.  
...  
<big>☻</big>
**cin pa, mi mus go a nun.**
– Grandfather, I have to go now.  
<big>☺</big>
**okei. ples sal tu su mama!**
– OK. Please tell greetings to your mother.  
<big>☻</big>
**mi sal da. sal reste!**
– I will. Bye!  
<big>☺</big>
**sal cut!**
– Bye!


### Grammar

Pandunia's singular personal pronouns are
**mi**
'I',
**tu**
'you', and
**da**
'he, she, it'.
Pandunia is a gender-neutral language.
It doesn't distinguish between sexes in the third person pronoun or any of the pronouns.
All the personal pronouns are present in the following example sentence.

**mi ples tu sal da.**
– I ask you to say hello to him/her.

This sentence has a _pivot structure_.
The first verb,
**ples**
('to ask, to beg'), addresses
**tu**
as its object. At the same time
**tu**
serves also as the subject of the second verb,
**sal**
('to greet'), whose object is
**da**.
So
**tu**
has a double role:
(1) object of the first verb and
(2) subject of the second verb.
Hence, it is the _pivot_ or hinge between the two verbs.

> Pivot Stucture: Subject + Verb¹ + Object/Subject + Verb² + Object

The pivot structure is a common structure in Pandunia.

Remember that it is allowed to leave out pronouns that are known in the context.
In other words the speaker can safely assume that the
listeners know who he or she is talking about.
So it is unnecessary to keep on repeating them.
In this manner phrases can be made shorter.

**mi ples tu sal da.**
– I ask you to say hello to him/her.  
**ples sal da.**
– Please say hello to him/her.

See how the translation of
**ples**
changed between the two sentences?
The meaning of the word, the concept, did not change, but its use did.
English reflects this change by using different words, to ask and please.
Pandunia can cope with changes like this without resorting to different words.
It is a principle in Pandunia that there is always exactly one word for one concept.
Different words are not created just because the grammatical role of a concept changes.

The phrase
**ples sal da**
has a useful pattern that can be used for making polite requests.

**ples side.**
– Please be seated.  
**ples don kafe.**
– Please give me some coffee.  
**ples don cha.**
– Please give me some tea.  
**ples yam cha.**
– Please have some tea.  
**ples safi kamre.**
– Please clean the room.

Commands are expressed more directly than requests.
A command is basically like the request but without the
**ples**.

**don cha!**
– Give (me) some tea!  
**safi kamre!**
– Clean the room!  
**safi da!**
– Clean it!

### Asking questions

Questions that can be answered by saying _yes_ or _no_ have the same pivot structure as requests with
**ples**,
which you learned in the previous lesson.
Question sentences are introduced with
**sual**
'to ask'.

**mi sual tu yam cha.**
– I ask (do) you drink tea.  
**sual tu yam cha?**
– Do you drink tea?  
**sual yam cha?**
– Drink tea?

Requests usually concern the one or the ones spoken to, but questions
are often about other people. Therefore the second pronoun is usually
needed. It can be left out only when it is clear who is the topic of
discussion.

**sual da yam cha?**
– Does he or she drink tea?  
**sual tu yam supa?**
– Do you eat soup?  
**sual mimen yam sui?**
– Do we drink water?

Of course common and proper nouns can also be used.

**sual shef yam kafe?**
– Does the chief drink coffee?  
**sual papa safi kamre?**
– Does the father clean the room?  
**sual Adam baxe pandunia?**
– Does Adam speak Pandunia?


### Giving answers

Yes/no questions can be answered with
**ya**
'yes', and
**no**
'no'.

– **sual tu yam supa?**
= Do you eat soup?  
– **ya.**
= Yes.  
– **sual da yam supa?**
= Does she eat soup?  
– **no.**
= No.

Also more complete answers can be given.

– **sual tu yam kafe?**
– Do you drink coffee?  
– **ya. mi yam kafe.**
– Yes, I drink coffee.  
– **sual da yam kafe?**
– Does he drink coffee?  
– **no. da no yam kafe.**
– No, he doesn't drink coffee.

It is also possible to answer yes by repeating the main verb of the question.

– **sual tu yam sui?**
– Do you drink water?  
– **yam.**
– (Yes, I) drink.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saying no

In the previous lesson you learned to answer
**ya**
and
**no**
to questions. The word
**no**
is used for denying something. Adding
**no**
in front of the verb turns an affirmative sentence to negative.

**mi sal tu.**
– I greet you.  
**mi no sal tu.**
– I do not greet you.

Conceptually negation means the absence or non-existence of the negated word.
In the phrase
**mi no sal tu**
the negative word
**no**
denies the existence of greeting.

In Pandunia the negative word affects the word that follows it.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location
of the negative word.

**mi cing tu safi kamre.**
– I ask you to clean the room.  
**mi no cing tu safi kamre.**
– I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**mi cing tu no safi kamre.**
– I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The negated word can be of any type: verb, pronoun, noun, adjective
and even numeral.

**da no have mau.**
– She doesn't have a cat.  
**da have no mau, ama gau.**
– She has no cats but dogs.  
**no da, ama mi have mau.**
– Not she but I have cats. (It's not her, but me who has cats.)  
**mi have no un, ama du mau.**
– I have not one but two cats.


### Exercises

5. The chief drinks tea but not coffee.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## More Questions

To ask questions beginning with _what_, _which_, _how_, _who_ and
_when_, the interrogative pronoun
**ke**
is normally used.
The question can be made more specific by adding words for person, time, manner or thing if needed.

**da es ke?**
– What is that? / Who is (s)he?  
**da es ke jen?**
– Who is he/she?  
**da es ke xe?**
– What (thing) is it?  
**ke jen lai?**
– Who is coming? (**jen** – person)  
**tu yam a ke zaman?**
– When do you eat? (**zaman** – time)  
**se danse a ke yang?**
– How to dance? (**yang** – manner, style)

In Pandunia, questions beginning with _why_ are asked using
**ke sabab**.

**ke sabab tu suka mau?**
– Why do you like cats?

Questions asking about the cause or reason of something, are answered by adding
**de sabab**
before the cause or reason.

**ke sabab tu suka mau?**
– Why do you like cats?  
**de sabab damen es kavai.**
– Because they are cute.

Of course,
**sabab**
can also be used to express the cause or reason for something,
even when not answering to a question.

**mi suka mau de sabab damen es kavai**
– I like cats because they are cute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Past, present and future

### Expressing time

There are no verb conjugations in Pandunia. All verbs have only one
form for all times. In a way they are similar to some English verbs,
such as "to hit", which is the same in all tenses.

**mi bate da.**
– I hit it.

In Pandunia all verbs are like that! For example,
**mi yam ban**
can mean both "I eat bread" and "I ate bread",
but usually only one or the other meaning makes sense in the context of the discussion.
For example when people talk about that morning's breakfast, the sentence tells about the past time.

**mi yam ban a ye suba yam.**
– I ate bread for this breakfast.

There are also specific time words.

**pas**
– in the past  
**zai**
– currently, at the moment  
**vil**
– later, in the future

They can be used for modifying nouns.

**Sara es mi su pas shef.**
– Sarah is my former boss.  
**Yusef es mi su zai shef.**
– Yusef is my current boss.  
**Maria es mi su vil shef.**
– Maria is my future boss.

The same words are used when you talk about actions and events in time.
Simply put the word before the verb.

**mi pas bate da.**
– I hit it (in the past).  
**mi zai bate da.**
– I am hitting it (currently).  
**mi vil bate da.**
– I will hit it (in the future).


It is not necessary to repeat the time expressions all the time.
It would be awkward.
It is enough to set the stage once in the beginning with a time expression.
Another time word will not be needed until the tense changes
or until it becomes useful to stress that you are still talking in the same tense.

**mi pas have un mau.**
– I had a cat in the past.  
**da es bon mau.**
– It was a good cat.  
**mi zai have un gau.**
– I now have a dog.

Any expression of time is good for expressing the tense. When one
time expression is present, other markers are not needed.

**mi bi gene a nen 2003.**
– I was born in 2003.  
**da safi kamre a pos den.**
– He will clean the room tomorrow.
