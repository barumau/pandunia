# The basics of Pandunia

Pandunia is a constructed language that has a minimalistic grammar and a globalistic vocabulary.

### Letters and sounds

Pandunia uses a systematic spelling where
each letter represents one spoken sound.

> A B Ch D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S Sh T U V X Y Z

The vowels **a, e, i, o, u** are pronounced as in "are there three or two".

The consonants are:
**b**,
**ch** (sounds like _ch_ in _church_),
**d**,
**f**,
**g** (always hard),
**h**,
**j**,
**k**,
**l**,
**m**,
**n**,
**p**,
**r** (never silent),
**s** (always voiceless),
**t**,
**v** (sounds like _w_),
**sh** (sounds like _sh_),
**y**,
**z**.

### Never changing words

Words don't ever inflect or change in Pandunia
– not even when they change their word class!
The same word, without any change in form, can serve as a noun, adjective or verb.

### Personal pronouns

| Person   | Singular          | Plural       |
|:---------|:-----------------:|:------------:|
|          | **mi**            | **vi**    |
| 1st      | _I, me_           | _we, us_     |
|          | **tu**            | **yu**    |
| 2nd      | _you_             | _you all_    |
|          | **da**            | **damen**    |
| 3rd      | _he/she, him/her_ | _they, them_ |

### Basic sentence structures

The particle **ya** 'yes' may separate the subject and the verb
when the subject is a noun.

**mau ya yam.**
– The cat eats.  
**jen ya sona.**
– The person sleeps.

If the subject is a personal pronoun, the **ya** is left out.

**mi yam.**
– I eat.  
**tu sona.**
– You sleep.  
**da sona.**
– He/she sleeps.

The basic word order is subject–verb–object
– the same as in English!

**mi love tu.**
– I love you.

When the direct object is a noun, it is marked apart from the verb by a demonstrative pronoun, numeral or another determiner.

**mi yam un pai.**
– I eat a pie.  
**tu yam ye pai.**
– You eat this pie.

### Negation

To negate a word, add **no** before it.

**mi no sona.**
– I don't sleep.  
**tu yam no jen.**
– You eat no-one.

### To be

The verb
**e**
means 'to be'.
It can be left out in very simple sentences.

**mi es jen.**
– I am a person.  
**mi jen.**
– I'm a person.

It can't be left out when it is part of a serial verb.

**mi van es mau.**
– I want to be a cat.  
**mi van mau!**
– I want a cat!

### Multi-purpose words

Pandunia words can be ambiguous because they often have more meanings compared to English.

**da love mau.**
– He loves cats. / She loved a cat. / He/she will love the cat.

But actually the meaning is clear in the real context:

**pre tri nen, mi have du mau e un vaf. mi have mas un fem ben. da love mau!**
– Three years ago, I had two cats and a dog. I also had a daughter. _She loved the cats!_

### Time

Tenses and aspects are optionally expressed with the help of adverbs and auxiliary verbs, like
**zai**
(currently),
**pas**
(in the past),
**ha**
(already), and
**vil**
(in the future).

**mi zai love tu.**
– I am loving you.  
**mi pas love tu.**
– I loved you.  
**mi ha love tu.**
– I have loved you.  
**mi vil love tu.**
– I will love you.

### Passive

The passive voice is formed with the help of the helping verb
**be**.

**tu be ai.**
– You are loved.  
**mi be love de tu.**
– I am loved by you.

### Modifying other words

To modify a noun, put adjectives before it.

**un neu ai**
– a new love  
**la hau pai**
– the good pie

To modify a verb, put adverbs before it.
The adverb can be tagged with
**li**.

**mi hau (li) visi tu.**
– I see you well.  
**tu visi li love da.**
– You seemingly love him/her.

Modifiers are compared with
**mas** 'more, -er', **masim** 'most, -est',
**min** 'less', **minim** 'least' and **par** 'equally, as'.
The point of comparison is introduced with **ka** 'than, as'.

**tu es mas sen ka mi.**
– You are older than me.  
**tu es masim sen.**
– You are the oldest.

### Questions

To ask _yes–or–no_ questions, replace the verb with "(verb) **no** (verb)" pattern or add **he** 'eh, huh' to the end of the sentence.

**tu visi no visi mi?**
– Do you see me?  
**tu visi mi, he?**
– You see me, eh?

To ask a content question, write a normal sentence and replace the word in question with
**kua**
'what, who'.

**tu love kua?**
– Who do you love?  
**tu love kua man?**
– Which man do you love?  
**kua man ya love tu?**
– Which man loves you?  
**tu love da kua li poli?**
– How much do you love him?

### Commands

To state a command, leave out the subject and start the sentence with the verb.

**yam ye pai!**
– Eat this pie!  
**visi vo mau!**
– Look at that cat!
