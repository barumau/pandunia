# 4. Pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

## Personal pronouns

Personal pronouns refer to people.
They are used as substitutes for a person's name.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi**      | **vi**       |
| I, me       | we           |
| **tu**      | **yu**       |
| you         | you all      |
| **da**      | **di**       |
| he or she   | they         |

All pronouns can be used for all genders.
In Pandunia, personal pronouns do not specify whether the person discussed is a woman or a man.
For example, in the third person, one word –
**da**
– refers to women, men and people of other genders alike.
It is a gender-neutral personal pronoun and it treats everyone equally.

There are three first-person plural pronouns.
**yumi**
is the inclusive *we* that includes the audience: 'you, I and other people'.
**dimi**
is the exclusive *we* that excludes the audience: 'I and other people only'.
Finally,
**vi**
is the neutral *we* that can be both inclusive and exclusive.
It is also the most common first-person plural pronoun,
and the other two are used only occasionally.

The possessive pronouns consists of the personal pronoun and the possessive particle
**se**.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi se**   | **vi se**    |
| my          | our          |
| **tu se**   | **yu se**    |
| your        | your         |
| **da se**   | **di se**    |
| his or her  | their        |


## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**selfe**
– self

Note! The same reflexive pronoun is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi visi selfe.**
– I see myself.  
**da visi selfe.**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**vi visi selfe.**
– We see ourselves.

The expression
**unotre**
is used as the reciprocal pronoun.

**unotre**
– each other, one another

**mi e tu visi unotre.**
– Me and you see each other.  
**vi visi unotre.**
– We see each other.


## Demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used with nouns to make them more specific.
The demonstrative pronouns in Pandunia are:

**da**
this, that  
**di**
these, those

As they do not differentiate between near and far, they can be further qualified by adding
**hir**
(_here_) or
**der**
(_there_).

**da hir haus**
= this house  
**di hir haus**
= these houses  
**da der haus**
= that house  
**di der haus**
= those houses  

The proximal demonstrative
**da hir**
points to things that are near the speaker.
The distal demonstrative
**da der**
points to things that are far from the speaker.

**tu van da der buke, he?**
– Do you want that book?  
**no, mi van da hir buke, no da der.**
– No, I want this book, not that.

The demonstratives can serve as subjects and objects in the same way as nouns.

**da hir es hau.**
– This is good.  
**da der es dus.**
– That is bad.  
**tu vol da hir, he?**
– Do you want this?  
**no, mi vol da der.**
– No, I want that.

When the verb is a content word,
there needs to be a modal particle,
like **ya** or **no**,
between the subject and the verb.

**mi visi du jen.**
– I see two persons.  
**da hir ya gani e da der no gani.**
– This one sings and that one doesn't sing.

The basic proximal and distal pronouns are used for introducing a new object.
The topical demonstrative **da**, on the other hand,
does not specify physical distance
but it is used when the speaker has already mentioned the object or person in question
and it is known by the audience or is topical within the discourse.

**da hir es mau. da van yam da der mushu.**
– This is a cat. It wants to eat that mouse.

**mi ave un mau e un vaf. da vaf es dai. da bi yam poli yam.**
– I have a cat and a dog. The dog is big. It eats a lot of food.


### Abstract use

The demonstrative pronouns can be used also discourse internally.
Then they refer to abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects.
**da**
refers to things previously spoken,
**da hir**
refers to things currently being spoken, and
**da der**
refers to things about to be spoken.

**da hir jumla es korte.**
– This sentence is short.

In the above,
**da hir jumla**
(_this sentence_) refers to the sentence being spoken.

**mi seme da der: mi love tu.**
– I mean this: I love you. OR I mean that I love you.  
**mi love tu. mi seme da.**
– I love you. That is what I mean.

In the above, the pronoun
**da der**
refers to the content of the next statement and
**da**
refers to the content of the previous statement.


## Interrogative pronouns

There are two interrogative pronouns in Pandunia.

**kua**
– what  
**hu**
– who

**da es kua?**
– What is it?  
**da es hu?**
– Who is it?  
**yu van kua?**
– What do you want?  
**kua es a table.**
– What is on the table?

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ke**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ke she?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ke jen?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ke zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  
**ke loke?**
– Where? (In which place?)  
**ke mode?**
– How? (What way?)  
**ke sabu?**
– Why? (What reason?)

Also adjectives are questioned with **ke**.

**ke nove?**
– How new?  
**ke koste?**
– How costy?  
**ke poli?**
– How many?  
**ke kam?**
– How few?  
**ke dai?**
– How big?  
**ke shau?**
– How small?

**tu ha ke dai di mau?**
– How big a cat do you have?
