# Spelling and pronunciation

## General

Pandunia has its own sound system and its own spelling system.
The speling system is phonetic in two directions:

1. When you read a word, you can always pronounce it.
2. When you hear a word, you can almost always write it.

There are two accents or manners of speaking Pandunia: complete and reduced.
The difference between them is that several sounds have a simplified pronunciation in the reduced accent.

## Note on phonetic notation

In this page, we use the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to show pronunciation in writing.
We use square brackets and slashes to show that we're talking about a sound and not a letter.

Physical speech sounds are written between square brackets,
for example [r] and [ɹ] indicate two different *r*-sounds, the trill and the glide.
However, [r] and [ɹ] are not distinguished in Pandunia, but they are perceived as one sound.
These mental sounds or **phonemes** can cover several physical sounds and are written between slashes.
So, speakers of Pandunia perceive mentally always one sound, /r/, regardless of which physical sound, [r] or [ɹ], is actually heard.
It is said that Pandunia has the phoneme /r/, which has alternative physical pronunciations [r] and [ɹ].
This can be annotated `/r/ = [r ~ ɹ]`.


## Basic Latin Alphabet

Pandunia is written in the basic Latin alphabet
– the same as English!
It doesn't have any of the accented letters, which are different from language to language.
So it can be typed, printed and viewed with computers and other smart devices in most countries without any difficulty.

There are 23 letters in the Pandunia alphabet: 5 vowels and 18 consonants.

> A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U V X Y Z

The spelling system is very consistent:
the great majority of words are written exactly as they are pronounced.
In general, what you see is what you say.
Every letter corresponds to a specific sound, and there are no silent letters.
However, there are well-defined exceptions,
and three letters are pronounced in more than one way.
They are *r* and *l* in the reduced accent,
and *x* in both dialects.
Once you have learned the way each letter is pronounced and the special rules,
you can read Pandunia aloud and be understood.


## Speech sound inventory

The complete speech sound inventory of Pandunia is presented in the table below.

|                    | Labial           | Alveolar        | Palatal        | Velar           | Glottal |

### Consonants with variable pronunciation

There are two major spoken Pandunia accents, complete and reduced.
They differ in the way how certain consonants are pronounced.

1.  *c* is pronounced [ts] in the complete accent and [s] in the reduced accent.
2.  The letter *x* is pronounced /ks/ in the complete accent.
    In the reduced accent, *x* is [ks] only between vowels, as in *taxi* /'tak.si/.
    In other positions it is reduced to [s], as in
    *xenon* /'se.non/, *max* /mas/, and *extra* /estra/.
3.  *n* is pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge,
    except in combinations *nk* and *ng*,
    where it is velar [ŋ] like in *banker* and *finger*.
    In the end of a word, the *g* in *ng* is silent in the reduced accent.
    For example, the word *pang* is pronounced [paŋ] in the reduced accent, and [paŋg] in the complete accent.
4.  *l* is pronounced [l] always in the complete accent.
    In the reduced accent, it is pronounced like *j* in consonant clusters.
    For example, the word *plate* is pronounced /'pla.te/ in the complete accent and /'pja.te/ in the reduced accent.
5.  The letter *r* has several alternative pronunciations.
    In the complete accent, it is pronounced as a vibration of the tip of the tongue,
    [r], as in Scottish and Indian English,
    or as a vibration of the uvula, [ʀ], as in German.
    Some speakers pronounce it as an alveolar approximant, [ɹ], as in American English.
    In the reduced accent, it is pronounced like *l* in the beginning and the end of a syllable.
    In consonant clusters, it is pronounced like the letter *v*.
    For example, the word *program* is pronounced /pro'gram/ in the complete accent and /pwo'gwam/ in the reduced accent.
5.  *v* is the labiodental approximant, [ʋ], in the complete accent, but some speakers pronounce it as the labiodental fricative, [v].
    In the reduced accent it is the bilabial approximant, [w].

### Consonants with similar pronunciation in both accents

Pronunciation of the other consonants is straightforward.

-   **p** = [pʰ] ~ [p]  
    *p* is pronounced with a puff of air as in *pin*.
-   **b** = [b]
-   **t** = [tʰ] ~ [t]  
    *t* is pronounced with a puff of air as in *tin*.
-   **d** = [d]
-   **k** = [kʰ] ~ [k]  
    *k* is preferably always pronounced with a puff of air as in *kin*.
-   **q** = **k**  
    *q* is pronounced as *k*.
    It is used only in the combination *qu* and in some loan words.
-   **g** = [g]  
    *G* is always hard as in *get*,
    never soft as in *gel*.
-   **f** = [f]
-   **s** = [s]
-   **z** = [z]
-   **sh** = [ʃ]  
    *sh* is pronounced as *sh* in *ship*.
-   **ch** = [tʃ]  
    *ch* is pronounced as *sh* in *chip*.
-   **j** = [dʒ]  
    *j* is pronounced as *j* in *jeans*.
-   **h** = [h] ~ [x]  
    *h* can be rougher than in English.
-   **m** = [m]
-   **y** = [j]  
    *y* is pronounced as the *y* in *yes*.


### Vowels

Pandunia has five oral vowel sounds.
They are represented by the letters *a*, *e*, *i*, *o* and *u* in the writing system.

The list below shows how each vowel is pronounced
by using the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
as well as pronunciation advice in plain English.

- **a** = [a]  
  *a* is pronounced as in *father*.
- **e** = [e]  
  *e* is pronounced as in *bet*.
- **i** = [i]  
  *i* is pronounced as in *machine*.
- **o** = [o]  
  *o* is pronounced as in *or*.
- **u** = [u]  
  *u* is pronounced as in *rule*.

In addition, there is an optional mid central vowel sound [ə], which is also called the **schwa**.
It is pronounced as the *a* in English *about* /əbaut/, *career* /kərir/ and *sofa* /soufə/.
It is the most basic vowel sound that can be created without much effort.
It is called optional because it is never written and in many cases not even pronounced.

The purpose of the schwa is to make speaking Pandunia easier.
It can be inserted after consonants that are difficult to pronounce without a vowel.
Different people can insert schwas in different places
depending on what is natural to them.
(There are native languages that don't allow any consonant cluster and final consonants.)
The schwa sound can be inserted between the consonants of a consonant cluster and after word-final consonants.
For example the word *skol* can be pronounced /skol/
or /səkol/ (where the initial consonant cluster is broken apart by a schwa)
or /səkolə/ (where the final consonant is followed by a schwa).
All these pronunciations sound almost the same,
because the schwa sound is always very short and unstressed.
Schwas don't ever change what syllable of the word is stressed!
Everybody is free to insert schwas or to omit them
depending on what is most comfortable for them.


### Semivowels

A semivowel is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions like a consonant as the syllable boundary.
Pandunia has two semivowels: **y** and **v**.
They appear only in the beginning of a syllable
and they are always followed by a full vowel.

- **v** = [w] ~ [ʋ] ~ [v]  
  *v* is pronounced as the *w* in *wet*,
  but some speakers may pronounce it more like the *v* in *vet*.
- **y** = [j]  
  *y* is pronounced as the *y* in *yes*.

There are also several common vowel sequences
– au, eu, ou, ai, ei, oi –
which are pronounced as the consecutive vowels with or without a hiatus in between.


## External letters and sounds

There are also additional letters and letter-combinations, which can be used only in *external words*,
which do not belong to the ordinary vocabulary of Pandunia, like names of places and people.
They are not used in any common Pandunia words.

- **kh** = [x]  
  Voiceless velar fricative, like *ch* in *Loch* in Scottish.
- **gh** = [ɣ]  
  Voiced velar fricative
- **ph** = [ɸ]  
  Voiceless bilabial fricative
- **bh** = [β]
  Voiced bilabial fricative
- **q** = [q]  
  Voiceless uvular stop.
- **qh** = [χ]
  Voiceless uvular fricative.
- **rh** = [ʀ] ~ [ʁ]  
  Voiced uvular trill or fricative like *rh* in *rhume* in Parisian French.
- **th** = [θ]  
  Like *th* in *thing*.
- **dh** = [ð]  
  Like *th* in *they*.
- **zh** = [ʒ]  
  Like *z* in *azure*.
- **w** = = [w] ~ [ʋ] ~ [v]  
  W is pronounced the same as **v**.

The additional letters and digraphs are used locally.
Their purpose is to help to transfer names in local languages to the international language,
so that local people can recognize them.
It's OK if you don't know how to pronounce any of these sounds.
The letters *c*, *q*, and *w* can be pronounced the same as *ch*, *k*, and *v*,
and all digraphs can be pronunced as if the *h* was not there.
So, for example, *zh* can be pronounced simply as *z* in the simplified international accent.


For example, the capital of Greece is called "Αθήνα" /aθina/ in the local language, Greek.
The Pandunia version of this name is "Athina".
It can be pronounced either /aθina/ (as the Greek do) or /atina/ (in the simplified international accent).

More examples:  
**Khartum**
Khartoum (the capital of Sudan)  
**Rhone**
Rhône (a river in France and Switzerland)  

## Word Structure

Pandunia words have a rather simple structure.
Syllables are structured `(C)(L)V(S)(C)` where

- `C` is a consonant.
- `L` is a liquid consonant (**l** or **r**)
   or a semivowel (**i** or **u**).
- `V` is a vowel.
- `S` is a semivowel (**i** or **u**),
- Sounds between brackets are optional.

In the table below there are some syllables from the lightest to the heaviest.
Each of them is also a word in Pandunia.

| Syllable | (C) | (L) |  V  | (S) | (C) | Word meaning |
|:---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-------------|
| **a**    |     |     |  a  |     |     | 'at'         |
| **ai**   |     |     |  a  |  i  |     | 'ow!'        |
| **an**   |     |     |  a  |     |  n  | 'un-'        |
| **pa**   |  p  |     |  a  |     |     | 'father'     |
| **pai**  |  p  |     |  a  |  i  |     | 'pie'        |
| **pan**  |  p  |     |  a  |     |  n  | 'all'        |
| **plan** |  p  |  l  |  a  |     |  n  | 'plan'       |


## Adapting Loan Words

As a general rule, loan words are adapted to the phonetic spelling system of Pandunia.
This rule is applied to both common words and proper names.

### Common words

A common word refers to a thing as a member of a group, not as an individual.
For example *dog* is a common word but *Sam* is not, it is a proper name.

Common words, which are in general use, must fit into the normal word structure,
and they must have only the normal sounds of Pandunia.

Many Pandunia words are structurally simpler than the corresponding English words.
Difficult consonant clusters are avoided in the beginning, middle and end of words,
so *psyche* is **sike**, *act* is **ate**, and *saint* is **sante** in Pandunia.


### Proper names

Proper nouns and rarely used common nouns can be more complex than ordinary words.
They can even include sounds that don't belong to the normal sound inventory of Pandunia.

For example, family name *Smith* may remain **Smith** in Pandunia,
although it is structurally more complex than normal Pandunia words,
and it has the external *th* sound.
However, foreign people probably will pronounce this name incorrectly.
Therefore it is advisable to adapt also proper names to the phonetic system of Pandunia.


## Large and small Letters

Pandunia has its own rules for using the large letters (i.e. upper-case letters) and the small letters (i.e. lower-case letters).

The only case when large letters are absolutely necessary is writing standard international acronyms,
because using wrong letter-case could result into wrong meaning.
For example, *1 mm* (**un milimitre**) means 'one thousandth of a metre'
and *1 Mm* (**un megamitre**) means 'one million metres'.
Otherwise all text in Pandunia can be written in small letters.
In particular, the first letter of sentences is not capitalized!

There are three reasons why large letters and rules about their usage are not necessary.

1. Writing represents speech and there are no "capital letters" in speech.
   Yet understanding spoken words is as easy as understanding written words in spite of this "shortcoming".
2. Most of the scripts and alphabets of the world have only one letter type,
   i.e. they don't have separate large and small letters.
3. It is simpler to use only small letters.
   No need for special rules for capitalization.

#### Proper names

Proper names *may* be capitalized according to the writers preference.
Family names *may* be written completely in large letters.
It is helpful because names are written in different way from language to language
and they can include several given names and family names.
However, all names may be written completely in small letters too.

    Examples of written names:
    (1) ludoviko lazaro zamenhof, edgar de val, mizuta sentaro
    (2) Ludoviko Lazaro Zamenhof, Edgar de Val, Mizuta Sentaro
    (3) Ludoviko Lazaro ZAMENHOF, Edgar de VAL, MIZUTA Sentaro


#### Acronyms

Initialisms, like **ASEAN**, **EU**, **NAFTA** and **UN**, are always written in large letters.
Other acronyms may use a mixture of large and small letters,
like for example **GULag**, which is an acronym of the Russian words "Glavnoye Upravleniye Lagerey".

Capital letters are also used in the standard international acronyms.
For example:
10 Mb (des megabite),
100 GB (sento gigabaite),
2 mm (du milimitre),
1 kJ (un kilojul).


## Syllabification

« - » Words may be divided into syllables with a hyphen.
The hyphen is placed between spoken syllables. For example:
**bus**, **ka-fe**, **hu-mor**, **pos-te**, **hi-drar-gen-te**.


## Punctuation

« . » All kinds of sentences may end with a full stop.

« ? » Questions may end alternatively with a question mark.

« ! » Exclamation mark indicates loudness or emphasis.

« ... » Three dots (i.e. ellipsis) indicates incompleteness or uncertainty.

« : » Colon indicates the beginning of an explanation, quotation or list.

« , » Comma indicates a small pause or separation between clauses or listed items.

Tip!
Because the first word of sentences is not capitalized,
sentences can be set apart with more than one space.
One may
(1) insert two spaces after the punctuation mark, or
(2) insert one space before and after the punctuation mark.
This practice helps to separate sentences more clearly.

    (1) sal!  tu gud, he?  mi vol go do kafekan.  tu vol lai kon mi, he?
    (2) sal ! tu gud, he ? mi vol go do kafekan . tu vol lai kon mi, he ?

In informal texts, smileys, emoticons and emojis may be used like punctuation marks to end sentences
but in addition they indicate the mood of the speaker.
For example **:)** indicates happiness and **:(** indicates sadness.

**mi ama tu :)**
– I love you.  
**tu no ama mi :(**
– You don't love me.
