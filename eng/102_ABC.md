# Spelling and pronunciation

Pandunia is phonetic in two directions:

1. When you read a word, you can always pronounce it.
2. When you hear a word, you can almost always write it.
   (Foreign names can be an exception.)

Once you have learned the few rules and the way letters are pronounced,
you can read Pandunia aloud and be understood.

## Basic Latin Alphabet

Pandunia is written in the basic Latin alphabet – the same as English!
It doesn't have any of the accented letters, which are different from language to language.
So it can be typed, printed and used with computers and smart devices in most countries without any difficulty.

## External letters and sounds

There are also additional letters and letter-combinations, which can be used only in _external words_,
which do not belong to the ordinary vocabulary of Pandunia, like names of individual places and people.
They are not used in any common Pandunia words.

| Pandunia | IPA    | Pronunciation advise |
|:--------:|:------:|:---------------------|
| c        | ts ~ s | Like _ts_ in _bits_ or like _c_ in _city_. |
| kh       | x      | Voiceless velar fricative, like _ch_ in _Loch_ in Scottish. |
| gh       | ɣ      | Voiced velar fricative |
| ph       | ɸ      | Voiceless bilabial fricative |
| bh       | β      | Voiced bilabial fricative |
| q        | q      | Voiceless uvular stop |
| qh       | χ      | Voiceless uvular fricative |
| rh       | ʀ ~ ʁ  | Voiced uvular trill or fricative like _rh_ in _rhume_ in Parisian French. |
| th       | θ      | Like _th_ in _thing_. |
| dh       | ð      | Like _th_ in _they_. |
| zh       | ʒ      | Like _z_ in _azure_. |
| w        | w ~ v  | |

The additional letters and digraphs are used locally.
Their purpose is to help to transfer names in the local language to the international language,
so that the local people can recognize them.
It's OK if you don't know how to pronounce any of these sounds.
The letters C, Q, and W can be pronounced the same as S, K, and V,
and the others can all be pronunced as if the H was not there.

For example, the capital of Greece is called "Αθήνα" /aθina/ in the local language, Greek.
The Pandunia version of this name is "Athina".
It can be pronounced either /aθina/ (as the Greek do) or /atina/ (in the simplified international accent).

Examples:  
**Athina** Athens (the capital of Greece)  
**Khartum** Khartoum (the capital of Sudan)  
**Rhone** Rhône (a river in France and Switzerland)  

## Word Structure

Pandunia words are structurally rather simple.
A syllable can include in maximum:

- one initial consonant
- one liquid consonant (**l** or **r**)
- one or two vowels, and
- one final consonant from the following:
  **m**, **n**, **ng**, **l**, **r**, **f**, **s**, **sh**,  **h**.

Certain consonant clusters are also allowed only between vowels, like **ks** and **zn**.

Some of the heaviest words in practice are **problem** and **simple**.


## Adapting Loan Words

As a general rule, loan words are adapted to the phonetic spelling system of Pandunia.
This rule is applied to both common words and proper names.

### Common words

A common word refers to a thing as a member of a group, not as an individual.
For example _dog_ is a common word but _Sam_ is not, it is a proper name.

Common words, which are in general use, must fit into the normal word structure,
and they can include only the normal sounds of Pandunia.

Most Pandunia words are structurally simpler than the corresponding English words.
Difficult consonant groups are avoided in the beginning, middle and end of words,
so _stadium_ is **estade**, _act_ is **ate**, and _saint_ is **sante** in Pandunia.
Also final stop consonants are avoided, so for example _soup_ is **supe** in Pandunia.


### Proper names

Infrequently used common nouns and proper nouns can be more complex than ordinary words.
They can even include sounds that don't belong to the normal sound inventory of Pandunia.

For example, family name _Smith_ may remain **Smith** in Pandunia,
although it is structurally more complex than common Pandunia words,
and it has the external _th_ sound.
However, foreign people probably will pronounce this name incorrectly.
Therefore it is advisable to adapt also proper names to the phonetic system of Pandunia.


## Large and small Letters

Pandunia has its own rules for using the large letters (i.e. upper-case letters) and the small letters (i.e. lower-case letters).

The only case when large letters are absolutely necessary is writing standard international acronyms,
because using wrong letter-case could result into wrong meaning.
For example, *1 mm* (**un milimitre**) means 'one thousandth of a metre'
and *1 Mm* (**un megamitre**) means 'one million metres'.
Otherwise all text in Pandunia can be written in small letters.
In particular, the first letter of sentences is not capitalized!

There are three reasons why large letters and rules about their usage are not necessary.

1. Writing represents speech and there are no "capital letters" in speech.
   Yet understanding spoken words is as easy as understanding written words in spite of this "shortcoming".
2. Most of the scripts and alphabets of the world have only one letter type,
   i.e. they don't have separate large and small letters.
3. It is simpler to use only small letters.
   No need for special rules for capitalization.

#### Proper names

Proper names *may* be capitalized according to the writers preference.
Family names *may* be written completely in large letters.
It is helpful because names are written in different way from language to language
and they can include several given names and family names.
However, all names may be written completely in small letters too.

    Examples of written names:
    (1) ludoviko lazaro zamenhof, edgar de val, mizuta sentaro
    (2) Ludoviko Lazaro Zamenhof, Edgar de Val, Mizuta Sentaro
    (3) Ludoviko Lazaro ZAMENHOF, Edgar de VAL, MIZUTA Sentaro


In titles of artistic works, like books, songs and films, every word may begin with a large letter.
For example,
**Putong Loge Da Human Hake**
(The Universal Declaration of Human Rights).

#### Acronyms

Initialisms, like **ASEAN**, **EU**, **NAFTA** and **UN**, are always written in large letters.
Other acronyms may use a mixture of large and small letters,
like for example **GULag**, which is an acronym of the Russian words "Glavnoye Upravleniye Lagerey".

Capital letters are also used in the standard international acronyms.
For example:
10 Mb (des megabite),
100 GB (sento gigabaite),
2 mm (du milimitre),
1 kJ (un kilojul).


## Syllabification

« - » Words may be divided into syllables with a hyphen.
The hyphen is placed between spoken syllables. For example:
**bus**, **ka-fe**, **yu-mor**, **pos-te**, **hi-drar-gen-te**.


## Punctuation

« . » All kinds of sentences may end with a full stop.

« ? » Questions may end alternatively with a question mark.

« ! » Exclamation mark indicates loudness or emphasis.

« ... » Three dots (i.e. ellipsis) indicates incompleteness or uncertainty.

« : » Colon indicates the beginning of an explanation, quotation or list.

« , » Comma indicates a small pause or separation between clauses or listed items.

Tip!
Because the first word of sentences is not capitalized,
sentences can be set apart with more than one space.
One may
(1) insert two spaces after the punctuation mark, or
(2) insert one space before and after the punctuation mark.
This practice helps to separate sentences more clearly.

    (1) sal!  tu hau, he?  mi vol ga to kafekan.  tu vol lai kon mi, he?
    (2) sal ! tu hau, he ? mi vol ga to kafekan . tu vol lai kon mi, he ?

In informal texts, smileys, emoticons and emojis may be used like punctuation marks to end sentences
but in addition they indicate the mood of the speaker.
For example **:)** indicates happiness and **:(** indicates sadness.

**mi vide tu :)**
– I see you.  
**tu no vide mi :(**
– You don't see me.
