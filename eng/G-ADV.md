# Adverbs

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

## Modifying a verb

In Pandunia, adverbs end in *-o* and their place is before the verb
or at the end of the sentence.

*`me bon-o    son-a.`*  
 `I  good-ADV sleep-V`  
'I sleep well.'

*`me son-a   bon-o.`*  
 `I  sleep-V good-ADV`  
'I sleep well.'

*`tu  bash-a  pandunia bon-o.`*  
 `you speak-V Pandunia good-ADV`  
'You speak Pandunia well.'

## Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier.
For example *day* (big) and *lil* (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

*dayi hom*
– a big person  
*lili jan*
– a little person  
*sundari jan*
– a beautiful person

*dayo sundari jan*
– very beautiful person  
*lilo sundari jan*
– somewhat beautiful person


## Comparison

Modifiers can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- *max*
  ('more') indicates comparison of superiority
- *maxim*
  ('most') indicates the superlative of superiority
- *min*
  ('less') indicates comparison of inferiority
- *minim*
  ('least') indicates the superlative of inferiority
- *paro*
  ('as' or 'equally') indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
*ka*
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

*aple sa max boni ka aranje.*
– Apples are better than oranges.  
*aranje sa min boni ka aple.*
– Oranges are less good than apples.  
*tu loga par bono ka me.*
– You speak as well as me.

It is also possible to compare modifiers with the following verbs,
which are directly attached to the object of comparison.

- *maxa*
  ('to exceed')
- *mina*
  ('to subceed')
- *para*
  ('to equal')

*aple maxa aranje sa boni.*
– Apples exceed oranges in being good. _meaning:_ Apples are better than oranges.  
*aranje mina aple sa boni.*
– Oranges subceed apples in being good. _meaning:_ Oranges are less good than apples.  
*tu para me loga bono.*
– You equal me in speaking well. _meaning:_ You speak as well as me.
