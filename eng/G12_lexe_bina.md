# 11. Word derivation

Making new words from existing words is called word derivation.
Often a new word is made by adding a prefix or suffix, such as _un-_ and _-ness_ in English.
For example, _un-happy_ and _happi-ness_ are derived from the root word _happy_.

New words can be built freely in Pandunia!
Pandunia has a word derivation system that is regular and productive.

## Zero Derivation

Zero derivation means conversion of a word of a certain word class to a different word class without any change in form.
This is very common in Pandunia,
where most words don't belong to any fixed word classes.
Instead, the word class is determined by the word's place in the sentence.

For example, the word
**hali**
can function equally as an adjective (_blank_ or _void_), noun (_a blank_) and verb (_to make blank_ or _to get blank_).

**tu hav hali papir, he?**
– Do you have some blank paper?  
**don mi un hali!**
– Give me a blank!  
**tu mus hali da lexe.**
– You must blank out that word.

Likewise, the word
**kitab**
can function as a verb (_to write_), a noun (_a writing_) and adjective (_written_ or _textual_).

**mi kitab letre.**
– I write a letter.  
**letre es kitab misaje.**
– A letter is a written message.  
**mi love yu's kitab.**
– I love your writings.


## Compound Words

A compound word is a word that is formed of two or more simpler words in order to yield a new meaning.
The last word is the most meaningful part in the compound
and the preceding words only modify its meaning.
New compound words can be created freely and easily in Pandunia.
There are two types of compound words in Pandunia, open compounds and closed compounds.

An open compound is simply a series of base words put next to each other.
They are written separately and there is a space between each pair of words.
For example, **tomato** 'tomato' + **sos** 'sauce' = **tomato sos** 'tomato sauce',

Closed compounds are written together and there is no space between the words.
For example, **poste** 'mail' + **kan** 'place for working' = **postekan** 'post office'.
Typically closed compounds include affixes.
Affixes are word-like units that have special properties.
Some of them are not stand-alone words,
they can only appear as part of another word.

Pandunia's system of word derivation is designed to produce compound words
that look and/or sound so close to international words that they are easy to recognize.
They are not meant to be identical with words in English or in any other language,
because international words tend to be written and pronounced in more or less different ways from language to language, anyway.
In fact, many compound words are built in a different way in Pandunia than in European languages,
though the results usually look mostly similar.


## Affixes

Affixes, i.e. prefixes and suffixes, are very important and give great flexibility to the language.
They are joined together with the base word.

Pandunia has adopted international prefixes,
including **a-**, **de-**, **pro-**, **re-** and **su-** among others,
in order to re-create many international words as native Pandunia words.

             a-      'to, toward'
       +    ses      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =      ases      'get past to, access'

           pro-      'forward, to the front'
       +    ses      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =    proses      'pass forward, process'

            re-      'back to'
       +    ses      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =     reses      'pass back, recede'

            de-      'away, off'
       +    ses      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =     deses      'pass away, die'

            su-      'good, well'
       +    ses      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =     suses      'go well, succeed'

Note that these international prefixes are used only in compound words that really mean the sum their parts.
Fossilized words whose meanings are no longer the sum of their parts,
like *evolution* (originally 'rolling out'),
are not compound words in Pandunia.

Many suffixes have two forms, one that begins with a vowel and one that begins with a consonant.
The vowel-initial form is used when the base word ends in a consonant or in the vowel **-e**,
which disappears before the suffix.
Below we add the vowel-initial suffix **-ik** to a base word that ends in a consonant.

             fiz       'body'
       +     -ik       'adjectival suffix'
    _____________
    =      fizik       'bodily, physical'

The consonant-intial form is used when the base word ends in any other vowel except **-e**.
Below we add the consonant-initial suffix **-tik** to a base word that ends in another vowel.

            tema       'theme, topic'
       +    -tik       'adjectival suffix'
    _____________
    =    tematik       'thematic, topical'

The vowel-initial suffix
**-ik**
and the consonant-initial suffix
**-tik**
are alternative forms of one and the same underlying suffix,
**(t)ik**,
which has an optional initial sound.
The surface form of the suffix depends on the properties of the base word.

Another suffix with two forms is **(o)krat**.
Its vowel-initial form is **-okrat**
and its consonant initial form is **-krat**.
So this time the optional sound is a vowel (and not a consonant as in **(t)ik**).

Below we add this suffix to a base word that ends in **-e**.

             dem      'people, public'
      +  (o)krat      'rule, govern'
      +      -ia      'collective noun suffix'
    ______________
    =  demokratia     'democracy, rule by the public'

Next we add the suffix to a base word that ends in another vowel.

           media      'the media'
      +  (o)krat      'rule, govern'
      +      -ia      'collective noun suffix'
    ______________
    = mediakratia     'mediacracy, rule by the media'
