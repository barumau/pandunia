# Basic words and phrases

## Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for
everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

English speakers will find it easy to make basic sentences in Pandunia as
the word order is generally the same as in English,
there are no definite or indefinite articles,
and no complicated rules about changing the form of words to express singular and plural or the tense of verbs.

The course consists of short lessons.
Each lesson introduces one new word, which is used in several different phrases in the lesson.
This is to teach you how the word works as part of sentences.
Possibly you will encounter also other new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them!
You don't have to learn all of them at once.
Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you!
Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends.
Read the phrases together and try to make small conversations.
You can also study alone.
Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations.
Repeat the same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on.
As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this.
They are there to clarify grammatical details for those who are interested.
You can skip over them if they are not helpful.
You don't have to know the theory of the language.
You can just speak Pandunia!
