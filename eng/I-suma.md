# The basics of Pandunia

Pandunia is a constructed language that has a minimalistic grammar and a globalistic vocabulary.

### Letters and sounds

Pandunia uses a systematic spelling where
each letter represents one spoken sound.

> A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U V X Y Z

The vowels **a, e, i, o, u** are pronounced as in "are there three or two".

The consonants are:
**b**,
**ch** (sounds like _ch_ in _church_),
**d**,
**f**,
**g** (always hard),
**h**,
**j**,
**k**,
**l**,
**m**,
**n**,
**p**,
**r** (never silent),
**s** (always voiceless),
**t**,
**v** (sounds like _w_),
**x** (sounds like _sh_),
**y**,
**z**.

### Never changing words

Words don't ever inflect or change in Pandunia
– not even when they change their word class!
The same word, without any change in form, can serve as a noun, adjective or verb.

### Personal pronouns

| Person   | Singular          | Plural       |
|:---------|:-----------------:|:------------:|
|          | **mi**            | **mimen**    |
| 1st      | _I, me_           | _we, us_     |
|          | **tu**            | **tumen**    |
| 2nd      | _you_             | _you all_    |
|          | **da**            | **damen**    |
| 3rd      | _he/she, him/her_ | _they, them_ |

### Basic sentence structures

The basic word order is subject–verb–object
– the same as in English!

**mi love tu.**
– I love you.

Grammar words help to distinguish the subject, verb and object.
Subject and object are noun phrases and they frequently begin with a grammar word,
such as a demonstrative pronoun, numeral or another determiner.
The verb is a verb phrase and it frequently begins with a grammar word,
such as an affirmative or negative particle, an auxiliary verb or a marker of tense, aspect or mood.

Example 1. Structurally unclear sentence.

*`mau yam fish.`*  
 `cat eat fish`  
'The cat eats fish.' (probable interpretation of the meaning)
    
Example 2. Structurally clear sentence with the affirmation of the verb.

*`mau ye  yam fish.`*  
 `cat yes eat fish`  
'The cat does eat fish.'

Example 3. Structurally clear sentence with the negation of the verb.

*̀`mau no  yam fish.`*  
 `cat no  eat fish`  
'The cat doesn't eat fish.'

Example 4. A complex but structurally clear sentence.

*`mi su  doste  hav    yam un  pai.`*  
 `me 's  friend ASPECT eat one pie`  
'My friend has eaten a pie.'


### Negation

To negate a word, add **no** before it.

**mi no sona.**
– I don't sleep.  
**tu yam no jen.**
– You eat no-one.

### To be

The verb
**es**
means 'to be'.
It can be left out in very simple sentences.

**mi es hom.**
– I am a human.  
**mi – hom.**
– I'm a human.

It can't be left out when it is part of a serial verb.

**mi vol es mau.**
– I want to be a cat.  
**mi vol mau!**
– I want a cat!

### Multi-purpose words

Pandunia words can be ambiguous because they often have more meanings compared to English.

**da love mau.**
– He loves cats. / She loved a cat. / He/she will love the cat.

But actually the meaning is clear in the real context:

**pre tri nen, mi have du mau e un gau. mi have plus un fem ben. da love mau!**
– Three years ago, I had two cats and a dog. I also had a daughter. _She loved the cats!_

### Time

Tenses and aspects are optionally expressed with the help of adverbs and auxiliary verbs,
like the aspect auxiliaries
**zai**
(be in the process of), and
**hav**
(have completed),
and the tense auxiliaries
**pas**
(in the past), and
**vil**
(in the future).

**mi zai love tu.**
– I am loving you.  
**mi hav love tu.**
– I have loved you.  
**mi pas love tu.**
– I loved you.  
**mi vil love tu.**
– I will love you.

### Passive

The passive voice is formed with the help of the verb
**bi**.

**tu bi love.**
– You are loved.  
**mi bi love di tu.**
– I am loved by you.

### Modifying other words

To modify a noun, put adjectives before it.

**un nove love**
– a new love  
**la bon pai**
– the good pie

To modify a verb, put adverbs before it.
The adverb can be tagged with
**li**.

**mi bon (li) vize tu.**
– I see you well.  
**tu vi li love da.**
– You seemingly love him/her.

Modifiers are compared with
**max**
'more, -er',
**maxim**
'the most... (of all)',
**min**
'less',
**linim**
'the least... (of all)', and
**sim**
'equally, as'.
The point of comparison is introduced with
**ka**
'than, as'.

**tu es max yun ka mi.**
– You are younger than me.  
**tu es maxim yun.**
– You are the youngest.

### Questions

To ask _yes–or–no_ questions, replace the verb with "(verb) **no** (verb)" pattern or add
**he**
'eh, huh' to the end of the sentence.

**tu vi no vi mi?**
– Do you see me?  
**tu vi mi, he?**
– You see me, eh?

To ask a content question, write a normal sentence and replace the word in question with
**ke**
'what, who'.

**tu love ke?**
– Who do you love?  
**tu love ke man?**
– Which man do you love?  
**ke man love tu?**
– Which man loves you?  
**tu love da ke multi?**
– How much do you love him?

### Commands

To state a command, leave out the subject and start the sentence with the verb.

**yam ye pai!**
– Eat this pie!  
**vide vo mau!**
– Look at that cat!
