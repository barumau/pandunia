# The basics of Pandunia

Pandunia is a constructed language that has a minimalistic grammar and a globalistic vocabulary.

### Letters and sounds

Pandunia uses a systematic spelling where
each letter represents one spoken sound.

> A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S T U V X Y Z

The vowels *a, e, i, o, u* are pronounced as in "are there three or two".

The consonants are:
*b*,
*ch* (sounds like _ch_ in _church_),
*d*,
*f*,
*g* (always hard),
*h*,
*j*,
*k*,
*l*,
*m*,
*n*,
*p*,
*r* (never silent),
*s* (always voiceless),
*sh* (sounds like *sh* in *shop*),
*t*,
*v* (sounds like _w_),
*x* (sounds like *s* or *ks*),
*y*,
*z*.

### Words

Words are made up of one or more roots and an ending.
The ending indicates the word-class or "part of speech".

-   Nouns end in *-e* or in a consonant
-   Adjectives end in *-i*
-   Adverbs end in *-o*
-   There are two endings for verbs:
    -   Verbs that end in *-a* indicate the subject–verb–object  (SVO) word order.
    -   Verbs that end in *u* indicate the subject–object–verb (SOV) word order.

### Nouns

Nouns indicate a group of one or more; definite or indefinite; masculine, neuter or feminine.
Number, definiteness and gender are indicated by additional words.

*mau*
– a cat, the cat, cats, the cats  
*un mau*
– one cat   
*multi mau*
– many cats  
*yi mau*
– the/this/that cat(s)

### Personal pronouns

| Person   | Singular          | Plural       |
|:---------|:-----------------:|:------------:|
|          | *me*              | *memen*      |
| 1st      | 'I, me'           | 'we, us'     |
|          | *tu*              | *tumen*      |
| 2nd      | 'you'             | 'you all'    |
|          | *ho*              | *homen*      |
| 3rd      | 'he/she, him/her' | 'they, them' |

### Basic sentence structures

The basic word order is subject–verb–object
– the same as in English!

*me ama tu.*
– I love you.

Word-class endings help to distinguish the subject, verb and object.

### Negation

To negate a word, add
*no*
before it.

*me no sona.*
– I don't sleep.  
*le yama no jan.*
– It eats no-one.

### To be

The verb
*sa*
means 'to be'.
It can be left out in very simple sentences.

*me sa hom.*
– I am a human.  
*me – hom.*
– I'm a human.

It can't be left out when it is part of a serial verb construction.

*me vola sa mau.*
– I want to be a cat.  
*me vola mau!*
– I want a cat!

### Multi-purpose words

Pandunia words can be ambiguous because they often have more meanings compared to English.

*ho ama mau.*
– He loves cats. ~ She loved a cat. ~ He or she will love the cat.

However, the precise meaning is usually clear in the actual context where the sentence is used.

*a pre da tri nien, me hava du mau e un gau. me hava maxo un dote. ho ama mau!*
– Three years ago, I had two cats and a dog. I also had a daughter. _She loved the cats!_

### Time

Tenses and aspects are optionally expressed with the help of adverbs and auxiliary verbs.


*me sta ama tu.*
– I am loving you.
(*sta* indicates ongoing time i.e. progressive aspect)  
*me paso ama tu.*
– I loved you.
(*paso* indicates the past time)  
*me fino ama tu.*
– I have loved you.
(*fino* indicates completed action i.e. the perfect(ive) aspect)  
*me vilo ama tu.*
– I will love you.
(*vilo* indicates future time)

### Passive

The passive voice is formed by using the verb ending *-u*
and changing the word order to the opposite,
so that the patient of the action is before the verb and the agent is after the verb.

*tu amu.*
– You are loved.  
*tu amu me.*
– You are loved by me.

### Modifying other words

Adjectives end in
*-i*.
They are usually before the noun that they modify,
but they can be can be after the noun, too.

*novi ame*
– a new love  
*boni pai*
– a good pie

Adverbs end in
*-o*.
They can be placed freely, but usually they are before the word that they modify.

*me bono viza tu.*
– I see you well.  
*tu vizablo ama ho.*
– You seemingly love him/her.  
*me multo ama tu.*
– I greatly love you.  
*me ama tu multo.*
– I love you greatly.


Adjectives and adverbs are compared with
*max*
'more, -er',
*maxim*
'the most...',
*min*
'less',
*minim*
'the least...', and
*par*
'equally, as'.
The point of comparison is introduced with
*ka*
'than, as'.

*tu sa max juni ka me.*
– You are younger than me.  
*tu sa maxim juni.*
– You are the youngest.

### Saying no

The word
*no*
denies the word that follows it.

*no me a ho vola kapa ho*
– Not me but he/she wants to take it.  
*me no vola kapa ho.*
– I don't want to take it.  
*me vola no kapa ho.*
– I want _not_ to take it.  
*me vola kapa no ho a de.*
– I want to take not it but that.

### Questions

To ask _yes–or–no_ questions, replace the verb with `(verb) *no* (verb)` pattern or add
*he*
'eh, huh' to the end of the sentence.

*tu viza no viza me?*
– Do you see me?  
*tu viza me, he?*
– You see me, eh?

To ask a content question, write a normal sentence and replace the word in question with
*que*
'what, who'
or prefix it with
*qui*
'which (one)' or
*quo*
'how'.

*tu ama que?*
– Who do you love?  
*tu ama qui man?*
– Which man do you love?  
*qui man ama tu?*
– Which man loves you?  
*tu ama ho quo multo?*
– How much do you love him?

### Commands

To state a command, leave out the subject and start the sentence with the verb.

*yama yi pai!*
– Eat this pie!  
*viza vi mau!*
– Look at that cat!
