# 4. Pronouns

Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns and noun phrases in a sentence.
They keep us from repeating the same words over and over again.
Here's an example of a sentence without pronouns:  
*My mother is a teacher but my mother is also a singer and my mother sings beautifully.*  
It sounds clumsy and repetitive.
Here's the same sentence with a personal pronoun:  
*My mother is a teacher but* ***she*** *is also a singer and* ***she*** *sings beautifully.*  
The latter sentence sounds fluent and smooth.


## Personal pronouns

Personal pronouns refer to people.
They are used in place of a person's name or title.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi**      | **vi**       |
| I, me       | we           |
| **tu**      | **yu**       |
| you         | you all      |
| **da**      | **di**       |
| he or she   | they         |

All pronouns can be used for all genders.
In Pandunia, personal pronouns do not specify whether the person discussed is a woman or a man.
For example, in the third person, one word –
**da**
– refers to women, men and people of other genders alike.
It is a gender-neutral personal pronoun and it treats everyone equally.

The singular 2nd person pronoun **tu** can be used in all situations, both formal and informal,
regardless of differences in social status and age of the speakers.
In this way it is similar to Swedish _du_.
However, some speakers may prefer to use **tu** only with family and intimate friends.
Then its usage is comparable to German _du_, French _tu_, Russian _ты_ (ty) and Hindi _tū_.

It is always acceptable to use the plural pronoun **yu**
instead of the singular pronoun **tu**.

There are three first-person plural pronouns.
**yumi**
is the inclusive *we* that includes the audience: 'you, I and other people'.
**dimi**
is the exclusive *we* that excludes the audience: 'I and other people only'.
Finally,
**vi**
is the neutral *we* that can be both inclusive and exclusive.
It is also the most common first-person plural pronoun,
and the other two are used only occasionally.

The possessive pronouns consists of the personal pronoun and the possessive particle
**se**.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi se**   | **vi se**    |
| my          | our          |
| **tu se**   | **yu se**    |
| your        | your         |
| **da se**   | **di se**    |
| his or her  | their        |


## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**sef**
– self

Note! The same reflexive pronoun
**sef**
is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi vize sef.**
– I see myself.  
**da vize sef.**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**vi vize sef.**
– We see ourselves.

The expression
**unotre**
is used as the reciprocal pronoun.

**unotre**
– each other, one another

**mi e tu vize unotre.**
– Me and you see each other.  
**vi vize unotre.**
– We see each other.


## Demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used with nouns to make them more specific.

Pandunia has two main demonstrative pronouns:

**da**
this, that  
**di**
these, those

As they do not differentiate between near and far, they can be further qualified by adding
**hir**
(_here_) or
**der**
(_there_).

**da haus**
– this or that house  
**di haus**
– these or those houses  
**da hir haus**
– this house  
**di hir haus**
– these houses  
**da der haus**
– that house  
**di der haus**
– those houses

The proximal demonstrative
**da hir**
points to things that are close to the speaker in terms of physical distance or relation.
The distal demonstrative
**da der**
points to things that are futher away from the speaker in terms of physical distance or relation.

**tu van da der buke, he?**
– Do you want that book?  
**no, mi van da hir buke, no da der.**
– No, I want this book, not that.

The demonstratives can serve as subjects and objects in the same way as nouns.

**da hir es gude.**
– This is good.  
**da der es bade.**
– That is bad.  
**tu van da hir, he?**
– Do you want this?  
**no, mi van da der.**
– No, I want that.

When the verb is a content word,
there needs to be a modal particle,
like **ye** or **no**,
between the subject and the verb.

**mi vize du jen.**
– I see two persons.  
**da hir ye gani e da der no gani.**
– This one sings and that one doesn't sing.

The basic proximal and distal pronouns are used for introducing a new object.
The topical demonstrative **da**, on the other hand,
does not specify physical distance
but it is used when the speaker has already mentioned the object or person in question
and it is known by the audience or is topical within the discourse.

**da hir es mau. da van yam da der mushu.**
– This is a cat. It wants to eat that mouse.

**mi have un mau e un vaf. da vaf es dai. da bi yam muche yam.**
– I have a cat and a dog. The dog is big. It eats a lot of food.


### Abstract use

The demonstrative pronouns can be used also discourse internally.
Then they refer to abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects.
**da**
refers to things previously spoken,
**da hir**
refers to things currently being spoken, and
**da der**
refers to things about to be spoken.

**da hir jumla es korte.**
– This sentence is short.

In the above,
**da hir jumla**
(_this sentence_) refers to the sentence being spoken.

**mi seme da der: mi love tu.**
– I mean this: I love you. OR I mean that I love you.  
**mi love tu. mi seme da.**
– I love you. That is what I mean.

In the above, the pronoun
**da der**
refers to the content of the next statement and
**da**
refers to the content of the previous statement.


## Interrogative pronouns

There are two interrogative pronouns in Pandunia.

**kua**
– what  
**hu**
– who

The interrogative pronoun takes the place of the questioned thing in the phrase.
It is not placed in the beginning of the phrase unlike normally in English.

**kua es da?**
– What is that?  
**hu es da?**
– Who is he ~ she?  
**yu van kua?**
– What do you want? (Literally: You want what?)  
**kua es a meza.**
– What is on the table?  
**hu es in haus.**
– Who is in the house?

The possessive interrogative pronoun is built like the other possessive pronouns.

**hu se**
– whose

**hu se haus es da?**
– Whose hose is that?

Adjectives are questioned with **kua li**.

**kua li nove?**
– How new?  
**kua li koste?**
– How costy?  
**kua li muche?**
– How many?  
**kua li kam?**
– How few?  
**kua li dai?**
– How big?  
**kua li lil?**
– How small?

**tu have kua li dai mau?**
– How big a cat do you have?


## Table of pronominals

A pronominal phrase is an expression that consists of several words and functions syntactically as a pronoun.
Pandunia's pronominal phrases can be arranged in a regular table of pronominals as below.
