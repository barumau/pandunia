# Word classes in Pandunia

## Introduction

Everybody knows at least two essential units of grammar: words and sentences.
In written texts, words are separated by spaces
and sentences end with a full stop.
However, there are also other grammatical units besides words and sentences.

Grammar involves a hierarchy of grammatical units,
which are listed below from the simplest to the most complex.

1. **Morpheme** is the **smallest part of language** with a meaning or function.
2. **Words** are made up of **one or more morphemes**.
3. **Phrases** are made up of **one or more words**.
4. **Clauses** are made up of **one or more phrases**.
5. **Sentences** are made up of **one or more clauses**.

Morphemes are the roots, affixes and endings in Pandunia.
Their job is to help to build the vocabulary of Pandunia.
The endings also help to organize the syntax.

One of the first things that an typical person notices about Pandunia is that its words seldom change.
Most words in Pandunia have one unchanging form,
which does not change according to number, case, gender, tense, mood or
any of the other inflectional categories known from other languages.
Compare, for example, what happens to the words in the following two sentences in Pandunia and English.

1. *me ama ho.*
   – I love him or her.
2. *ho ama me.*
   – He or she loves me.

In Pandunia, the pronouns *me* 'I' and *ho* 'he or she' simply change places and that's it.
All words stay the same, and only their order changes.
In contrast, in English, the subject *I* changes to *me* when it becomes the object,
the object *him* changes to *he* when it becomes the subject,
and the verb *love* changes to *loves* in order to agree with the new subject.
Changes like this are called grammatical inflections,
and languages that use them are called *inflected languages*.

Languages that have very few grammatical inflections or free from all grammatical inflections are known as *isolating languages*.
Pandunia is not an isolating language, but it has very few grammatical inflections indeed.
There are only two inflections in Pandunia, the verb endings *-a* and *-u*, which indicate the order of the agent and patient in the clause.
The other endings, *-e*, *-i* and *-o*, are not inflections, they are derivations.

Pandunia is an exceptionally simple language.
It is so simple that we don't need specialized or complicated words to describe how it works.
That's why all things in this grammar are explained in plain words
and basic terms that you have probably already learned in school.
And don't worry if you don't remember some of them,
all terms are explained when they are met for the first time.

## Simple but powerful grammar

Pandunia has a grammar that is systematic, regular and also very flexible.
There is a simple root-and-ending system at the core of the grammar.
Every word is made of one or more roots and an ending, which is attached to the root.

Pandunia uses a simple array of five vowel endings, which indicate clearly the word class of every word.

- Nouns end in *-e*, e.g. *buke* 'book'.
- Adjectives end in *-i*, e.g. *buki* 'bookish'
- Adverbs end in *-o*, e.g. *buko* 'bookishly'.
- Verbs end in either *-a* or *-u* depending on the order of clause constituents.

The vowel endings make syntax transparent.
In Pandunia, one can know the grammatical structure of a sentence without knowing the meaning of the words.
For example, consider the following sentence where root words are hidden.

    ░░░e ░░░░░a ░░░░i ░░░░e.

In other languages nothing could be guessed only by the last vowels of words,
but in Pandunia they reveal the structure of the whole sentence.
First, the word classes can be known, because they are indicated by the vowel endings.
The first word is a noun because it ends in *-e*,
the next one is a verb because it ends in *-a*,
and the last two are an adjective and a noun ending in *-i* and *-e* respectively.
Second, the constituents of the sentence and their order can be known from the word classes.
The sentence consists of
a subject, which is the first noun,
a predicate, which is the verb,
and an object, which consists of the adjective and the noun in the end.
The word order is thus subject–verb–object.

        ░░░░e     ░░░░░a     ░░░░i      ░░░░e.
         │          │          │          │
    ┌────┴────┐┌────┴────┐┌────┴────┐┌────┴────┐
    │  noun   ││ A-verb  ││adjective││  noun   │
    └────┬────┘└────┬────┘└────┬────┘└────┬────┘
         │          │          └────┬─────┘
    ┌────┴────┐┌────┴────┐     ┌────┴────┐
    │ subject ││predicate│     │ object  │
    └─────────┘└─────────┘     └─────────┘

The vowel endings form the grammatical structure of sentences,
and the meaning or content comes from root words.
A root word is a word without an ending,
like *bac-* 'child', *kitab-* 'writing', *long-* 'length' and *letr-* 'letter'.
A root with an ending is a complete word,
like *bace* 'child' (noun) and *kitaba* 'write' (verb).
The roots and endings together create the complete meaning of a sentence.

    ░░░░e   ░░░░░a    ░░░░i ░░░░e.
    bache   kitaba    longi letre.
    'The child writes a long letter.'


## Flexible grammar, free word order

Thanks to its flexible grammatical structure, word order is free in Pandunia.

Subject, verb and object can be arranged in any order,
which is a good thing, because different languages use different word orders.
The subject–verb–object order is the most common order by number of speakers,
and the subject–object–verb order is the most common order by number of languages.
The examples below show how clause constituents are arranged in various languages
– and how freely they can be arranged in Pandunia!

| Language       | Subject        | Verb           | Object         |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| English:       | *The child*    | *writes*       | *a letter*     |
| French:        | *L'enfant*     | *écrit*        | *une lettre.*  |
| Spanish:       | *El niño*      | *escribe*      | *una carta.*   |
| German:        | *Das Kind*     | *schreibt*     | *einen Brief.* |
| Mandarin:      | *Háizi*        | *xiě*          | *xìn.*         |
| Malay:         | *Anak*         | *menulis*      | *surat.*       |
| Pandunia:     | ***bache***    | ***kitaba***   | ***letre.***   |

| Language       | Subject        | Object         | Verb           |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Turkish:       | *Çocuk*        | *mektubu*      | *yazar.*       |
| Hindi:         | *bacca*        | *patr*         | *likhata hai.* |
| Japanese:      | *kodomo wa*    | *tegami o*     | *kakimasu.*    |
| Pandunia:     | ***bache***    | ***letre***    | ***kitabu.***  |

| Language       | Verb           | Subject        | Object         |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Arabic:        | *yaktab*       | *al-tifl*      | *risālatan*    |
| Tagalog:       | *Nagsusulat*   | *ang bata*     | *ng liham.*    |
| Pandunia:     | ***kitabu***   | ***bache***    | ***letre.***   |

In most languages only one word order is possible or normal.
For example, in English it is nearly impossible to say things in the subject–object–verb order.
You can't say simply *the child the letter writes*.

Word order is free also in other cases.
For example, adjectives can be placed before the noun or after the noun.
In Pandunia, one can say *bache suki* or *suki bache* and the meaning is the same: 'a happy child'.
In most languages one or the other order is preferred or even required.
For example, in English the noun-last order (e.g. *a happy child*) is normal, and the opposite order (e.g. *a child happy*) would sound abnormal.
In Spanish it's the opposite: the noun-first order (e.g. *un niño feliz*) is normal and the noun-last order (e.g. *un feliz nīno*) is abnormal.

In Pandunia, even adpositions can be placed before nouns as prepositions (as in English) or after nouns as postpositions (as in Japanese and Hindi).
The level of flexibility in Pandunia is uncomparable!

But why free word order matters?
Because it makes it easy to approach Pandunia.
There are more than one way to begin speaking the language.
Most other languages can offer only one way that is right and all other ways are wrong.
Therefore a big part of learning is actually about unlearning old habits.
Not in Pandunia!

Learning courses can be tailor-made for specific audiences.
When one teaches Pandunia to speakers of language X, it's smartest to teach a form of Pandunia that is close to language X.
For example, speakers of Turkish would grasp easily Pandunia that uses Turkish-like word orders (subject–object–verb, adjective–noun and postpositions)
whereas speakers of Malay would grasp easily Pandunia that uses Malay-like features (subject–verb–object, noun–adjective and prepositions).

Pandunia courses can be made so that there is maximum similarity between the source language and the target language (Pandunia) in early stages of learning.
This is a unique feature of Pandunia.
However, as learners make progress, texts in Pandunia can be adjusted little by little toward the international standard of the language.


## Quick word derivation

Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation.
In this system the final vowel of a word indicates its word class.
So the root (i.e. stem) of the word indicates a general idea
and the vowel endings indicate different manifestations of that idea.

Pandunia uses the following vowel endings to mark parts of speech.

No vowel or **-e** indicates a noun,
which is the name of the thing or idea that the root is about.
Nouns answer to the question: What?

**-ia** indicates a collective noun,
which means the totality of the things that the root is about.
It can also indicate an abstract noun.
For example,
**humania**
means "humanity" both as the collective "humankind" and as the abstract "humanhood".

**-i** indicates an adjective,
which describes the main characteristic or quality of the root.
Adjectives answer to the following questions: What kind? How many?

**-o** indicates an adverb,
which describes a manner or a circumstance (ex. place or time).
Adverbs answer to the following questions: How? Where? When?

**-a** indicates an active verb,
which is an action that a person can do with the corresponding noun.
So the purpose or the potential of the noun determines the meaning of the verb.

**-u** indicates a passive verb,
which is an event that happens or an action that is done to someone.
The meaning of a passive verb depends on the corresponding active verb.

These endings and the participles (**-an-** and **-it-**) are the only true suffixes i.e. bound morphemes in Pandunia.
All other suffixes can be used also as independent words.
For example **paciste** (pacifist) is made up of two full words:
**pace** (peace) and **iste** (proponent).

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of word from another.
An ending is simply changed to another ending.
All endings can be used on all roots in the same way.

- The ending **-e** converts the idea into a thing.
  For example, **nile** means the color blue.
- The ending **-i** converts the idea into a description.
  The resulting adjective describes another idea with the modifying idea.
  For example, **nili dome** means a blue house.
- The ending **-a** converts the idea into an action.
  The resulting verb is about using the idea to an object.
  For example, **nila dome** means "to make the house blue".
- The ending **-u** creates an action just like **-a**.
  The only difference is that the word order is reversed so that the object comes first.
  For example, **dome nilu** means "the house becomes blue".

Here are a few examples of different types of ideas.

- concrete action
    - **kitabe**
      'writing, text' (noun)
    - **kitabi**
      'written, textual' (adjective)
    - **kitabo**
      'by writing, textually' (adverb)
    - **kitaba**
      'to write' (active verb)
    - **kitabu**
      'to be written' (passive verb)
- abstract action
    - **fikre**
      'thought' (noun)
    - **fikri**
      'thought' (adjective)
    - **fikro**
      'by thought' (adverb)
    - **fikra**
      'to think' (active verb)
    - **fikru**
      'to be thought' (passive verb)
- description
    - **longe**
      'length' (noun)
    - **longi**
      'long, lengthy' (adjective)
    - **longo**
      'lengthily' (adverb)
    - **longa**
      'to make long, lengthen' (active verb)
    - **longu**
      'to get long, be lengthened' (passive verb)
- emotion
    - **suke**
      'delight' (noun)
    - **suki**
      'delighted, happy' (adjective)
    - **suko**
      'happily' (adverb)
    - **suka**
      'to delight, please' (active verb)
    - **suku**
      'to be delighted, be pleased' (passive verb)
- tool
    - **hamar**
      'a hammer' (noun)
    - **hamari**
      'hammerlike' (adjective)
    - **hamaro**
      'by/with/like a hammer'
    - **hamara**
      'to hammer, to use hammer on sth' (active verb)
    - **hamaru**
      'to be hammered' (passive verb)


### Deriving verbs

**-a** and **-u** are the endings for verbs.

1. If the stem's idea is an action, then its verb form will mean "to do the action".
   For example from **vize** ('a look') we get **viza** ('to look').
2. If the idea is a description then its verb form will mean "to turn into that quality".
   For example from **nevi** ('new') we get **neva** ('to make new' or 'to renew').
3. If the idea is a thing, then its verb form will mean "to apply it to".
   For example from **hamar** ('hammer') we get **hamara** ('to hammer').


### Deriving nouns

**-e** is the ending for nouns.

If the stem's idea is an action, then its noun form will mean the result or the product of the action.
For example from **kitaba** ('to write') we get **kitabe** ('writing' or 'text').

If the idea is a description, then its noun form will mean a concrete instance of that quality.
For example from **nevi** ('new') we get **neve** ('a novelty' i.e. something new).

Additional noun suffixes are presented below.

### Deriving adjectives

**-i** is the ending for adjectives and adjectival verbs.

If the stem's idea is a description, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is in the state of the root".
For example from **nev-** ('newness'), we get **nevi** ('new' i.e. 'that which is new').

If the idea is an action, then its adjectival form will mean the state that is produced by the action.
For example from **loga** ('to speak') we get **logi** ('spoken').

If the idea is a thing, an object or a person, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is like the root".
For example, from the noun **human** ('human being'), we get the adjective **humani** ('human', having the attributes of a human being).

If the root is a place word, then its adjectival form will mean 'that which is from that place'.

**Rusia** Russia, **Rusi** Russian  
**Pakistan** Pakistan, **Pakistani** Pakistani  
**Amerike** America, **Ameriki** American  
**Europe** Europe, **Europi** European  
**Asia** Asia, **Asi** Asian
