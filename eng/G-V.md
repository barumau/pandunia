# Verbs

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, for example *to eat*, *to speak*, *to look* and *to think*.

Pandunia has three verb grades: agentive, patientive, and stative.
The grades are indicated by the vowel endings *-a*, *-u* and *-i* respectively.
There are no verb inflections for other things, like person, number, time and mood,
which are common in other languages, like English.
Things like that are indicated by separate words in Pandunia.

## Person and number

Person and number are indicated by the subject.
For example, the verb
*sa*
('to be') has the same form in all persons.

*me sa doste.*
– I am a friend.  
*tu sa doste.*
– You are a friend.  
*ho sa doste.*
– He/she is a friend.  
*memen sa doste.*
– We are friends.  
*tumen sa doste.*
– You are friends.  
*homen sa doste.*
– They are friends.

Also a noun can serve as subject.

*mau sa hevan.*
– The cat is an animal.

## Agent and patient roles

### What are agent and patient?

A verb can involve an agent (abbreviated *A*) and a patient (abbreviated *P*).
The agent is the active participant,
which brings about an event and has control over it.
The patient is the passive participant,
which is affected by the event.

Agent and patient can mean many things,
but prototypical agents and patients share certain characteristics.

The prototypical agent

1. is alive
2. can move
3. participates in the event by its own will
4. causes a change in another participant
5. exists independently of the event.

Consider the sentence *a player kicked the ball to the goal*.
The *player* is the agent because he is alive, moves, kicks the ball by its own will and causes a change of place in the ball.

The prototypical patient

1. might be a non-living thing
2. is standing still in relation to another participant
3. is drawn into the event by another participant
4. undergoes a change because of the event
5. might not exist without the event.

Consider again the sentence *the player kicked the ball to the goal*.
The ball is the patient, because it's a non-living thing, it stood still in relation to the player, it is drawn to the event by the player and it undergoes a change of place.

     The player  kicked  the ball.
    └─────┬────┘└──┬───┘└────┬────┘
        AGENT     VERB    PATIENT

Consider another sentence, *the player scored a point*.
Here the *point* is the patient, because it would not exist without the event.
In fact, it undergoes a change of state from non-existence into existence.

     The player  scored  a point.
    └─────┬────┘└──┬───┘└────┬────┘
        AGENT     VERB    PATIENT


There are two types of verbs in Pandunia.
Their difference is that they indicate opposite orders of agent and patient.

1. Forward verbs end in *-a*,
   and they are immediately preceded by the agent and immediately followed by the patient.
2. Backward verbs end in *-u*,
   and they are immediately preceded by the patient and immediately followed by the agent.

Note that the verb types deal only with the word order.
They don't have anything to do with passivity or transitivity,
which are manifested on the clause-level.

### Forward verbs (A-verbs)

Verbs that end in *-a* are called _forward verbs_
because the energy that originates from the agent flows forward via the verb tow the patient.

    AGENT ───> A-VERB ───> PATIENT

The verb is the only necessary member of a clause.
A minimal phrase can consist of a verb only,
as in phrase B below.

A: *tu loga o auda?*
– Do you you talk or listen?  
B: *auda.*
– (I) listen.

Sometimes a verb is accompanied by only one participant,
either agent or patient.
If there is a word immediately before the A-verb, it is the agent.

    ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗
    │  AGENT  │→║  A-VERB  ║
    └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝

*`me loga.`*  
 `A    V`  
'I speak.'

If there is a word immediately after the A-verb, it is the patient.

    ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐
    ║  A-VERB  ║→│ PATIENT │
    ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘

*`viza ye!`*  
 ` V   P`  
'Watch this!'

There are three possible word orders when both agent and patient are present:
agent–verb–patient (AVP),
patient–agent–verb (PAV),
and verb–patient–agent (VPA).

The most common word order is agent–verb–patient (AVP).
This is the direct word order
that is normally used.

         ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐
    AVP: │  AGENT  │→║  A-VERB  ║→│ PATIENT │
         └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘

*me viza homen.*
– I see them.  
*tu beka ban.*
– You bake bread.

The second order is patient–agent–verb (PAV).

          ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗
    PAV:  │ PATIENT │ │  AGENT  │→║  A-VERB  ║
          └─────────┘ └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝
                ↑                       │
                └───────────────────────┘

It is used when the speaker wants to draw the focus on the patient.
It is used for fronting the question word.
It is also common in dependent clauses.

Examples:  
*que tu viza?*
– What do you see?  
*me yama ban,* ***de*** *tu beka.*
– I eat bread **that** you baked.


The third possible order is the verb–patient–agent order (VPA), which is rarely used.

         ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
    VPA: ║  A-VERB  ║→│ PATIENT │ │  AGENT  │
         ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
             ↑                        │
             └────────────────────────┘

This order can be use used when the speaker wants to add the agent as an afterthought or clarification.

*viza tu, ho di feme.*
– Sees you, that woman.


### Backward verbs (U-verbs)

Verbs that end in *-u* are called _backward verbs_,
because the energy flows backward to the patient via the verb from the agent.

    PATIENT <─── U-VERB ───> AGENT

The arguments of backward verbs are exactly in the opposite order compared to forward verbs.

Sometimes a verb is accompanied by only one participant,
either agent or patient.
If there is a word immediately before the U-verb, it is the patient.

    ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗
    │ PATIENT │←║  A-VERB  ║
    └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝

*`nave mergu.`*  
 ` P     V`  
'Ship sank.'

If there is a word immediately after the U-verb, it is the agent.

    ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐
    ║  A-VERB  ║←│  AGENT  │
    ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘

*`venu man.`*  
 ` V   A`  
'Came a man.'

There are three possible word orders for U-verbs when both agent and patient are present:
patient–verb–agent (PVA),
agent–patient–verb (APV),
and verb–agent–patient (VAP).

The patient-verb-agent order is common in the passive voice,
where the focus is on the passive recipient of the action.

         ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐
    PVA: │ PATIENT │←║  U-VERB  ║←│  AGENT  │
         └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘

This order is usually translated to English by using the passive voice or an intransitive verb,
but sometimes a transitive verb can be used too.

Examples:  
*ban beku tu.*
– Bread is baked by you.  
*kupe parcu.*
– The cup broke ~ got broken.  
*rajer suku homen.*
– The king is pleased by them. ~ The king likes them.

The most common order is agent–patient–verb (APV).
It is used typically in the active voice, where the the focus is on the agent of the action.

The APV order is equivalent to the subject–object–verb word order (SOV)
that is the most common word order by number of languages.
It is the normal word order in languages like Latin, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, Hindi and Tamil.
SOV is followed by SVO (i.e. AVP) as the second-most common order.
Together they account for almost 90% of the world's languages.

         ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ╔══════════╗
    APV: │  AGENT  │ │ PATIENT │←║  U-VERB  ║
         └─────────┘ └─────────┘ ╚══════════╝
             │                        ↑
             └────────────────────────┘

Examples:  
*me homen vidu.*
– _I them see._  
*tu ban beku.*
– _You bread bake._

The verb–agent–patient order is very rare but possible.
This order is similar to the VSO word order of Classical Arabic and Filipino.

         ╔══════════╗ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
    VAP: ║  U-VERB  ║←│  AGENT  │ │ PATIENT │
         ╚══════════╝ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
             │                        ↑
             └────────────────────────┘

*vidu me tu.*
– 'I see you.'


### Stative verbs

In Pandunia, also adjectives can be used as verbs.
When adjectives are usd in that role, they are called **adjectival verbs** or **stative verbs**.
They are basically adjectives that describe the subject in a verb-like manner.
The subject of a stative verb is in the state denoted by the verb root.
Stative verbs are frequently accompanied by the verb
*sa*
'to be'.
When it is optional, it is marked inside brackets in the following examples.

*me (sa) seni.*
– I am old.  
*me vola sa juni.*
– I want to be young.  
*tu di buke (sa) boni.*
– Your book is good.

Stative verbs differ from other verbs by the fact that
a stative verb is about being in a state
whereas other verbs indicate a change of state.

Stative verbs are always intransitive.
They can't take an object.


## Time and mood


### Tense

Tense is a property that expresses time reference.
The main tenses are the past, present, and future.
The marker
*pasa*
indicates the past tense,
*nun*
indicates the present tense, and
*futa*
indicates the future tense.
More specific time references are expressed with various time expressions, like *yesterday*, *tomorrow* or *one hour ago*.

*man* ***pasa*** *yama ban.*
– The man *ate* (or *did eat*) bread.  
*man* ***nuno*** *yama ban.*
– The man *eats* bread (now).  
*man* ***futa*** *yama ban.*
– The man *will eat* bread.

It is also possible to express the future in the past
with a combination of two tense markers.

*man* ***pasa futa*** *yama ban.*
– The man *was going to* eat bread.


### Aspect

Aspect expresses how an action or event extends over time.

*shura*
('to begin or start')
indicates beginning of an action or transition to a new situation.
In linguistics it is called the **inchoative** or **inceptive** aspect.

*me shura fuka kote.*
– I start wearing the coat. ~ I put the coat on.  
*kaguje shura piru.*
– Paper starts to burn.  
*tu shura yama.*
– You start to eat.

*fina*
('to end, cease, quit or stop')
conveys the idea of "to stop doing something".
In linguistics it is called the **terminative** or **cessative** aspect.

*homen fina haha.*
– They stopped laughing.  
*kaguje fina piru.*
– Paper ceased to burn.  
*tu fina yama.*
– You stop eating.

*pula*
('to fulfill or complete')
indicates that an action is done completely.
In linguistics it is called the **perfective** aspect.

*tu pula yama piza.*
– You ate a pizza (completely).  
*me pula viza filme.*
– I completed watching the film. / I watched the film completely.

*dura*
('to keep on, continue or proceed')
indicates that a situation is on-going, continuing or in progress
at the time, which the speaker is talking about.
In linguistics it is called the **continuative** or **progressive** aspect.

*tu dura yama piza.*
– You keep on eating pizza.

A more common way to express continuation is to use the verb
*sta*
('to stay')
in the sense 'to be in the process of'.

*tu sta yama piza.*
– You are eating pizza.  
*me sta viza filme.*
– I am watching the film.

**ha**
('to exist')
indicates that the action or event is complete
and its result has still an effect at the time, which the speaker is talking about.
This aspect resembles what is called the **perfect tense** in English grammar.

*me ha dona buk pa homen.*
– I have given the book to them. (So I don't have it.)  
*homen no ha redona le pa me.*
– They haven't given it back to me. (So probably they still have it.)  
*me ha vena pa pol.*
– I have come to the city. (So I am still there.)

<!--
Note that it is possible to negate the auxiliary verb
*ha*
and the main verb separately.

*me no ha gula alkol.*
– I haven't drank alcohol.  
*me ha no gula alkol.*
– I have reached the state of not drinking alcohol.
-->

<!--
### Mood

The conditional mood is used for anything that could take place.
It indicates that the realization of an action or event depends on another condition.
The conditional mood is expressed with the auxiliary verb
*vud*
('would').
This marker is used in both main and subordinate clauses.

*me* ***vud*** *vol yama.*
– I *would* like to eat.  
*me* ***vud*** *go to Dubai.*
– I *would* go to Dubai.  
*me* ***vud*** *go, if tu vud las me.*
– I *would* go if you would let me.  
*tu no* ***vud*** *sa suka, if me* ***vud*** *go.*
– You would not be happy, if I would go.

The auxiliary verb
*debu*
('should, ought') indicates some kind of expectation like duty, obligation, requirement, desire, advisability or likelihood.

*ma voka memen. memen debu go.*
– Mother called us. We should go.  
*ho debu ha vena pre nun.*
– He should have come by now.  
*evri von debu vote.*
– Everyone should vote.

The imperative mood is used to form a command or request.
In Pandunia, the imperative is created with the auxiliary verb
*shal*.
It can be used to give commands to any person, not just "you".

*memen shal go!*
– Let us go! ~ Let's go!  
*homen shal kursa!*
– Let them run!

*shal*
can be used to give commands also to the second person,
but it is common to drop both the personal pronoun and the auxiliary verb
in order to give the command more force.

*tu shal vena!* = *vena!*
– Come!  
*tumen shal vena!* = *vena!*
– Come (you all)!

## Participles

*-nt-*
denotes someone or something that does the action of the root.
It is the active participle suffix.

*loga*
– to speak  
*loganti*
– speaking  
*logante*
– the one who speaks  
*padu*
– to fall  
*padunti*
– fallen  

*-t-*
denotes someone or something that undergoes the action of the root.
It is the passive participle suffix.

*loga*
– to speak  
*logati*
– spoken  
*pada*
– to drop  
*padati*
– dropped  
*una*
to unite
→ *unati*
united


### Causative verbs

The causatives are the verbs that are used to indicate
that one person causes another person to do something.
It can be by asking, paying, requesting, or forcing the person.

Sometimes the simple active verb is causative.

*Tomas pada xeke.*
– Thomas drops a stone.  
*xeke padu.*
– Stone falls.

In other situations, the causative is formed by using one of the participle suffixes.
*-ana* means that someone causes someone to do something.
*-ita* means that someone causes something to be done to someone or something.

*Sara padana Tomas.*
– Sara causes Thomas to drop (something).  
*Sara padita xeke.*
– Sara causes the stone to be dropped.

Here is a more complete example.
Note that *to feed* has two different causative meanings in English.

*pex yamu.*
– Fish is eaten.  
*mau yama pex.*
– The cat eats fish.  
*me yamita pex pa mau.*
– I feed fish to the cat.  
*me yamana mau va pex.*
– I feed the cat with fish.

A causative can imply that the action is done for the causer.

*me no bina dom. me binata ho.*
– I don't build the house. I have it built (for myself).


## Serial verb construction

Serial verb construction is a string of verbs that share the same subject,
which is before the verbs.
In serial verb constructions the verbs are interpreted so that
the first verb (an auxiliary verb) is something that the subject possesses
and the second verb is something that the subject does (when there is an object in the end)
or experiences (when there is no object).

*me saba kitaba javab.*  
≈ *I have the ability to write the answer.*  
– I can write the answer.  
*me halalu kitaba javab.*  
≈ *I have the permission to write the answer.*  
– I may write the answer.  
*me musu kitaba javab.*  
≈ *I have the compulsion to write the answer.*  
– I must write the answer.

Note that the same auxiliary verbs can be used alone as transitive verbs in the pivot construction.

*guru halala me kitaba javab.*
