## Nouns

### Only one form

A noun is a word that refers to a concrete or abstract object,
such as *person*, *tree*, *house*, *life* and *speed*.
Like all words in Pandunia, nouns don't ever change in form.
The same word form is always used, no matter whether the referred thing is singular or plural, definite or indefinite, subject or object, etc.
Therefore the same Pandunia word form can correspond to many different word forms in English.

**ite**
– a stone, stones, the stone, or the stones  
**meza**
– a table, tables, the table, or the tables  
**kursi**
– a chair, chairs, the chair, or the chairs  
**sui**
– water, the water

Number and definiteness are often known because they were previously mentioned in the conversation or because they are general knowledge.
For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **lun** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and moon.


### Indicating number

Pandunia nouns have the same form
in singular (when there is one)
and plural (when there is more than one).
Therefore all Pandunia nouns are like the English words
_sheep_, _deer_ and _fish_,
which also have only one form though they can refer to one or many things.

In Pandunia, the number is indicated only when it matters and when it is new information.
It is done simply by inserting a number or a quantity word before the noun.

**meme**
– (one or more) sheep  
**un meme**
– a sheep or one sheep  
**du meme**
– two sheep  
**tri meme**
– three sheep  
**men meme**
– many sheep

**kursi**
– a chair or chairs  
**un kursi**
– one chair  
**du kursi**
– two chairs  
**tri kursi**
– three chairs  
**men kursi**
– many chairs

It is possible to specify plurality also by reduplication, by saying the noun two times.

**ite ite**
– stones and stones, a variety of stones  
**buku buku**
– books and books, a variety of books

Quantity words should not be used together with reduplication.
Therefore, a phrase like
**men buku buku**
is wrong.

### Proper names

Proper names are nouns for individual people, places and other things.

Names of people can be tagged with the universal title of respect
**xi**.
Using it shows respect and politeness.

It can be used in formal and informal situations and for all age groups, social groups and genders.
The closest translation for it in English is _Mr or Ms_ or _Mx_.

There are different customs concerning honorific titles in different cultures.
In some cultures it is not polite to use someone's name without a title of respect.
Therefore it is advisable to use **xi** always when you meet new people from different cultures.

A title of respect can be used with a given name, a family name, or both.

**xi Bili King**
– Mx Billy King  
**xi Bili**
– Mx Billy  
**xi King**
– Mx King


### Compound words

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word.
The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound,
and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

**sol foto**
– sun light  
**luna foto**
– moon light  
**luna ite**
– moon stone
