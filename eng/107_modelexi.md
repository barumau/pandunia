# 7. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality or description,
such as good, bad, big, and fast, to another word.
In Pandunia, there is only one class of modifiers.
The same word can modify nouns and verbs,
whereas in English only _adjectives_ can modify nouns
and only _adverbs_ can modify verbs.
For example, the word
**mei**
('beautiful' or 'beautifully')
modifies a noun in sentence A
and a verb in sentence B.

A. **vo es _mei_ kitabe.**
– That is a beautiful writing.  
B. **tu _mei_ di kitabe.**
– You write _beautifully_.


## Modifying nouns

In Pandunia, "adjectives" are modifiers that are placed before the noun that they modify.

**un _neu_ gar**
– a _new_ car  
**un _suga_ gar**
– a _fast_ car  
**men _dai_ meza**
– _big_ tables  
**men _gau_ meza**
– high tables  
**un hau jen**
– a good person

Two or more modifiers can modify the same noun.

**un shau nova gar**
– a little new car


## Modifying verbs

A modifier that modifies a verb
is placed immediately before the verb.

**tu _suga_ loge.**
– You talk _fast_.  
**damen _hau_ kitabu.**
– They write _well_.

It is common to put the modifying particle
**di**
between the modifier and the verb.
It makes the structure of the verb phrase clearer.

**tu _mei di_ kitabe.**
– You write _beautifully_.  
**damen _suga di_ marche.**
– They walk _fast_.


## Modifying other modifiers

The particle
**di**
is used also when a modifier modifies another one.

**un _dai di_ hau buku**
– a _greatly_ good book  
**poli _bala di_ ai ja jen**
– _strongly_ loving people


## Degree words

Degree words tell us about the intensity of something.

**tre**
– very  
**bas**
– quite, sufficiently, enough  
**max**
– more  
**min**
– less
**max ka bas**
– too  

Degree words are placed before the word that they modify.

**un dai man**
– a big man  
**un tre dai man**
– a very big man  
**un bas dai man**
– a big enough man / a sufficiently big man
**un max dai man ka bas**
– a too big man  

A degree word together with a modifier forms a _compound adverb_
that can modify a verb or a sentence.
The compound adverb is placed immediately before the verb that it modifies.

**tre poli**
– very much  
**mi _tre poli_ vol loge.**
– I want very much to speak.  
**mi vol _tre poli_ loge.**
– I want to speak very much.

It is also possible to place the compound adverb very last in the sentence,
and then it modifies the sentence as a whole.
The meaning is the same like when the compound adverb modifies the main verb.

**mi vol loge _tre poli_.**
– I want to speak very much.  
**sual tu sona _bas hau_?**
– Did you sleep well enough?


## Adverbs of comparison

Adjectives can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- **max**
  (_more_) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim**
  (_most_) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim**
  (_least_) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **par**
  (_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**ka**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple e max hau ka aranja.**
= Apples are better than oranges.  
**aranja e min hau ka aple.**
= Oranges are less good than apples.  
**tu loge par hau ka mi.**
= You speak as well as me.
