# 4. Pronouns

Pronouns are words that take the place of nouns and noun phrases in a sentence.
They keep us from repeating the same words over and over again.
Here's an example of a sentence without pronouns:  
*My mother is a teacher but my mother is also a singer and my mother sings beautifully.*  
It sounds clumsy and repetitive.
Here's the same sentence with a personal pronoun:  
*My mother is a teacher but* ***she*** *is also a singer and* ***she*** *sings beautifully.*  
The latter sentence sounds fluent and smooth.


## Personal pronouns

Personal pronouns refer to people.
They are used in place of a person's name or title.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi**      | **mimen**    |
| I, me       | we           |
| **tu**      | **tumen**    |
| you         | you all      |
| **da**      | **damen**    |
| he or she   | they         |

All pronouns can be used for all genders.
In Pandunia, personal pronouns do not specify whether the person discussed is a woman or a man.
For example, in the third person, one word –
**da**
– refers to women, men and people of other genders alike.
It is a gender-neutral personal pronoun and it treats everyone equally.

The singular 2nd person pronoun **tu** can be used in all situations, both formal and informal,
regardless of differences in social status and age of the speakers.
In this way it is similar to Swedish _du_.
However, some speakers may prefer to use **tu** only with family and intimate friends.
Then its usage is comparable to German _du_, French _tu_, Russian _ты_ (ty) and Hindi _tū_.

It is always acceptable to use the plural pronoun **yu**
instead of the singular pronoun **tu**.

There are three first-person plural pronouns.
**tumimen**
is the inclusive *we* that includes the audience: 'you, I and other people'.
**damimen**
is the exclusive *we* that excludes the audience: 'I and other people only'.
Finally,
**mimen**
is the neutral *we* that can be both inclusive and exclusive.
It is also the most common first-person plural pronoun,
and the other two are used only occasionally.

The possessive pronouns consists of the personal pronoun and the possessive particle
**su**.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi su**   | **mimen su** |
| my          | our          |
| **tu su**   | **tumen su** |
| your        | your         |
| **da su**   | **damen su** |
| his or her  | their        |


## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**se**
– self

Note! The same reflexive pronoun
**se**
is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi vi se**
– I see myself.  
**da vi se**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mimen vi se.**
– We see ourselves.

The expression
**semen**
is used as the reciprocal pronoun.

**semen**
– each other, one another

**tu e mi vi semen.**
– You and I see each other.  
**mimen vi semen.**
– We see each other.


## Demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used with nouns to make them more specific.
The demonstrative pronouns in Pandunia are:

**ye**
– this (near the speaker)  
**vo**
– that (far from speaker)  
**la**
– the (known by both the speaker and the listener)

The proximal demonstrative
**ye**
points to things that are near the speaker.
The distal demonstrative
**vo**
points to things that are far from the speaker.

**tu vol vo buku, he?**
– Do you want that book?  
**no, mi vol ye buku, no vo.**
– No, I want this book, not that.

The demonstratives can serve as subjects and objects in the same way as nouns.

**ye es bon.**
– This is good.  
**vo es dus.**
– That is bad.  
**tu vol ye, he?**
– Do you want this?  
**no, mi vol vo.**
– No, I want that.

When the verb is a content word,
there needs to be a modal particle,
like **ya** or **no**,
between the subject and the verb.

**ye ya vi du jen.**
– This one sees two persons.  
**ye ya gani i vo no gani.**
– This one sings and that one doesn't sing.

The basic proximal and distal pronouns are used for introducing a new object.
The topical demonstrative
**la**,
on the other hand,
does not specify physical distance
but it is used when the speaker has already mentioned the object or person in question
and it is known by the audience or is topical within the discourse.

**ye e mau. da vol yam vo muxu.**
– This is a cat. It wants to eat that mouse.

**mi have un mau e un vaf. la vaf es dai. da zai yam multi yam.**
– I have a cat and a dog. The dog is big. It eats a lot of food.


### Abstract use

The demonstrative pronouns can be used also discourse internally.
Then they refer to abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects.
**la**
refers to things previously spoken,
**ye**
refers to things currently being spoken, and
**vo**
refers to things about to be spoken.

**ye jumla es korte.**
– This sentence is short.

In the above,
**ye jumla**
(_this sentence_) refers to the sentence being spoken.

**mi sema vo: mi love tu.**
– I mean this: I love you. OR I mean that I love you.  
**mi love tu. mi sema la.**
– I love you. That is what I mean.

In the above, the pronoun
**vo**
refers to the content of the next statement and
**la**
refers to the content of the previous statement.


## Interrogative pronouns

**ke**
is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The interrogative pronoun takes the place of the questioned thing in the phrase.
It is not placed in the beginning of the phrase unlike normally in English.

**ke es da?**
– What is it?  
**ke es vo jen?**
– Who is that person ~ he ~ she?  
**tu vol ke?**
– What do you want? (Literally: You want what?)  
**ke es a meza.**
– What is on the table?  
**ke es in haus.**
– Who is in the house?

The possessive interrogative pronoun is built like the other possessive pronouns.

**ke su**
– whose

**ke su haus es da?**
– Whose hose is that?

Also adjectives are questioned with **ke**.

**ke nove?**
– How new?  
**ke koste?**
– How costy?  
**ke multi?**
– How many?  
**ke kam?**
– How few?  
**ke dai?**
– How big?  
**ke lit?**
– How small?

**tu have ke dai mau?**
– How big a cat do you have?
