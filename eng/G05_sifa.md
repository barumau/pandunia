# 7. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality or description,
such as good, bad, big, and fast, to another word.
In Pandunia, there is only one class of modifiers.
The same word can modify nouns and verbs,
whereas in English only _adjectives_ can modify nouns
and only _adverbs_ can modify verbs.
For example, the word
**mei**
('beautiful' or 'beautifully')
modifies a noun in sentence A
and a verb in sentence B.

A. **da es _mei_ kitabe.**
– That is a beautiful writing.  
B. **tu _mei_ li kitabe.**
– You write _beautifully_.


## Modifying nouns

In Pandunia, "adjectives" are modifiers that are placed before the noun that they modify.

**un _nove_ karo**
– a _new_ car  
**un _rapide_ karo**
– a _fast_ car  
**meni _dai_ meza**
– _big_ tables  
**meni _gau_ meza**
– high tables  
**un hau jen**
– a good person

Two or more modifiers can modify the same noun.

**un lil nove karo**
– a little new car


## Modifying verbs

A modifier that modifies a verb
is placed immediately before the verb.

**tu _rapide_ loga.**
– You talk _fast_.  
**di jen _hau_ kitabe.**
– They write _well_.

It is common to put the modifying particle
**li**
between the modifier and the verb.
It makes the structure of the verb phrase clearer.

**tu _mei li_ kitabe.**
– You write _beautifully_.  
**di _rapide li_ marche.**
– They walk _fast_.


## Modifying other modifiers

The particle
**li**
is used also when a modifier modifies another one.

**un _dai li_ hau buke**
– a _greatly_ good book  
**_bala li_ lovente jen**
– _strongly_ loving people


## Degree words

Degree words tell us about the intensity of something.

**vere**
– very  
**bas**
– quite, sufficiently, enough  
**mor**
– more  
**les**
– less

Degree words are placed before the word that they modify.

**un dai man**
– a big man  
**un vere dai man**
– a very big man  
**un bas dai man**
– a big enough man / a sufficiently big man

A degree word together with a modifier forms a _compound adverb_
that can modify a verb or a sentence.
The compound adverb is placed immediately before the verb that it modifies.

**vere muche**
– very much  
**mi _vere muche_ van loga.**
– I want very much to speak.  
**mi van _vere muche_ loga.**
– I want to speak very much.

It is also possible to place the compound adverb very last in the sentence,
and then it modifies the sentence as a whole.
The meaning is the same like when the compound adverb modifies the main verb.

**mi van loga _vere muche_.**
– I want to speak very much.  
**sual tu sona _bas hau_?**
– Did you sleep well enough?


## Adverbs of comparison

Adjectives can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- **mor**
  (_more_) indicates comparison of superiority
- **mor... of hol**
  (_most... of all_) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **les**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **les... of hol**
  (_least... of all_) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **sim**
  (_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**dan**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple es mor hau dan aranja.**
= Apples are better than oranges.  
**aranja es les hau dan aple.**
= Oranges are less good than apples.  
**tu loga sim hau dan mi.**
= You speak as well as me.
