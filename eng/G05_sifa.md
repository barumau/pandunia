# 7. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality or description,
such as good, bad, big, and fast, to another word.
In Pandunia, there is only one class of modifiers.
The same word can modify nouns and verbs,
whereas in English only _adjectives_ can modify nouns
and only _adverbs_ can modify verbs.
For example, the word
**mei**
('beautiful' or 'beautifully')
modifies a noun in sentence A
and a verb in sentence B.

A. **he es _mei_ kitab.**
– That is a beautiful writing.  
B. **tu _mei_ li kitab.**
– You write _beautifully_.


## Modifying nouns

In Pandunia, "adjectives" are modifiers that are placed before the noun that they modify.

**un _nov_ kar**
– a _new_ car  
**un _rapid_ kar**
– a _fast_ car  
**meni _dai_ meza**
– _big_ tables  
**meni _gau_ meza**
– high tables  
**un _gud_ jen**
– a good person

Two or more modifiers can modify the same noun.

**un lit nov kar**
– a little new car


## Modifying verbs

A modifier that modifies a verb
is placed immediately before the verb.

**tu _rapid_ log.**
– You talk _fast_.  
**di jen _gud_ kitab.**
– They write _well_.

It is common to put the modifying particle
**li**
between the modifier and the verb.
It makes the structure of the verb phrase clearer.

**tu _mei li_ kitab.**
– You write _beautifully_.  
**di _rapid li_ marche.**
– They walk _fast_.


## Modifying other modifiers

The particle
**li**
is used also when a modifier modifies another one.

**un _dai li_ gud buk**
– a _greatly_ good book  
**_bala li_ lovente jen**
– _strongly_ loving people


## Degree words

Degree words tell us about the intensity of something.

**ver**
– very  
**bas**
– quite, sufficiently, enough  
**mor**
– more  
**les**
– less

Degree words are placed before the word that they modify.

**un dai man**
– a big man  
**un ver dai man**
– a very big man  
**un bas dai man**
– a big enough man / a sufficiently big man

A degree word together with a modifier forms a _compound adverb_
that can modify a verb or a sentence.
The compound adverb is placed immediately before the verb that it modifies.

**ver much**
– very much  
**mi _ver much_ van log.**
– I want very much to talk.  
**mi van _ver much_ log.**
– I want to talk very much.

It is also possible to place the compound adverb very last in the sentence,
and then it modifies the sentence as a whole.
The meaning is the same like when the compound adverb modifies the main verb.

**mi van log _ver much_.**
– I want to talk very much.  
**sual tu sona _bas gud_?**
– Did you sleep well enough?


## Adverbs of comparison

Adjectives can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

**mor**
(_more_) indicates comparison of superiority  
**mor... dan hol**
(_most... of all_) indicates the superlative of superiority  
**les**
(_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority  
**les... dan hol**
(_least... of all_) indicates the superlative of inferiority  
**sim**
(_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**dan**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple es mor gud dan aranja.**
– Apples are better than oranges.  
**aranja es les gud dan aple.**
– Oranges are less good than apples.  
**tu log sim gud dan mi.**
– You talk as well as me.
