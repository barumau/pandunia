# 11. Word derivation

Making new words from existing words is called word derivation.
Often a new word is made by adding a prefix or suffix, such as _un-_ and _-ness_ in English.
For example, _un-happy_ and _happi-ness_ are derived from the root word _happy_.

New words can be built freely in Pandunia!
Pandunia has a word derivation system that is regular and productive.

## Zero Derivation

Zero derivation means conversion of a word of a certain word class to a different word class without any change in form.
This is very common in Pandunia,
where most words don't belong to any fixed word classes.
Instead, the word class is determined by the word's place in the sentence.

For example, the word **hali** can function equally as an adjective (_blank_ or _void_), noun (_a blank_) and verb (_to make blank_ or _to get blank_).

**tu ha hali papir, he?**
– Do you have some blank paper?  
**don mi un hali!**
– Give me a blank!  
**tu mus hali vo lexi.**
– You must blank out that word.

Likewise, the word
**kitabu**
can function as a verb (_to write_), a noun (_a writing_) and adjective (_written_ or _textual_).

**mi kitabu letre.**
– I write a letter.  
**letre e kitabu misije.**
– A letter is a written message.  
**mi ai tu su kitabu.**
– I love your writings.


## Compound Words

A compound word is a word that is formed of two or more simpler words in order to yield a new meaning.
New compound words can be created freely and easily in Pandunia.
There are two types of compound words in Pandunia.

1. Closed compounds are written together and there is no space between the words.
   For example, **poste** 'mail' + **kan** 'place for working' = **postekan** 'post office'.
2. Open compounds are written separately and there is a space between the words.
   For example, **tomato** 'tomato' + **sos** 'sauce' = **tomato sos** 'tomato sauce',

There is little or no difference between open compounds and closed compounds in Pandunia from grammatical point of view.
Compound words that are well-established tend to be closed compounds,
while unestablished and improvised compound words tend to be open compounds.

Pandunia's system of word derivation is designed to produce compound words
that look and/or sound so close to international words that they are easy to recognize.
They are not meant to be identical with words in English or in any other language,
because international words tend to be written and pronounced in more or less different ways from language to language.
In fact, compound words are built in a different way in Pandunia than in European languages,
though the results usually look mostly similar.

For example, English word *antidemocratic* can be divided into parts thus: *anti-dem-o-crat-ic*.
It is completely made up of bound morphemes, units that can't stand alone
but that can only appear as part of another word.
The corresponding Pandunia word,
**antidemikratika**,
is made up of stand-alone words
and it could be written also as an open compound:
**anti demi krati ka**.
The structure of this compound word in Pandunia is identical with the corresponding word in Mandarin,
*fǎn mín zhǔ de* (反民主的).
So Pandunia's word derivation system is structurally closer to the East Asian type than the European type.

| Pandunia | English | Mandarin |
|----------|---------|----------|
| anti     | anti-   | fán      |
| demi     | dem-    | mín      |
|          | -o-     |          |
| krati    | crat-   | zhǔ      |
| ka       | -ic     | de       |


## Affixes

Affixes, i.e. prefixes and suffixes, are very important and give great flexibility to the language.
They are joined or merged to the base word.

For example, the word **Geia** 'planet Earth' consists of the base word **gei** 'earth, ground'
and the collective noun suffix **-ya**.

           gei       'earth, ground'
       +   -ya       'collective noun suffix'
    _____________
    =      Geia      'planet Earth, Gaia'

Two or more roots can be put together to make _compound words_.
The last root is the most meaningful part in the compound
and the preceding roots only modify its meaning.

           pan       'all'
       +  demi       'people, public'
       +   -ka       'adjectival suffix'
    _____________
    = pandemika      'pandemic'

The connecting vowel **-o-** is inserted between the elements in Greek compounds.

           demi      'people, public'
       +  krati      'rule, govern'
       +    -ya      'collective noun suffix'
    _____________
    = demikratia     'democracy'

          termi      'temperature'
       +  metri      'measure'
       +     -r      'agent or apparatus'
    ____________
    = termimetrir     'thermometer'

Pandunia has adopted international prefixes,
including **a-**, **de-**, **pro-**, **re-** and **su-** among others,
in order to re-create many international words as native Pandunia words.

             a-      'to, toward'
       +   sesi      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =     asesi      'get past to, access'

           pro-      'forward, to the front'
       +   sesi      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =   prosesi      'pass forward, process'

            re-      'back to'
       +   sesi      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =    resesi      'pass back, recede'

            de-      'away, off'
       +   sesi      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =    desesi      'pass away, die'

            su-      'good, well'
       +   sesi      'go, pass'
    ____________
    =    susesi      'go well, succeed'

Note that these prefixes are used only in compound words that really mean the sum their parts.
Fossilized words whose meanings are no longer the sum of their parts,
like *evolution* (originally 'rolling out') and *revolution* (originally 'rolling back'),
are not compound words in Pandunia.
