# Word derivation

Making new words from existing words is called word derivation.
Often a new word is made by adding a prefix or suffix, such as _un-_ and _-ness_ in English.
For example, _unhappy_ and _happiness_ are derived from the root word _happy_.

New words can be built freely in Pandunia!
Pandunia has a word derivation system that is regular and productive.

## Zero Derivation

Zero derivation means conversion of a word of a certain word class to a different word class without any change in form.
This is very common in Pandunia,
where most words don't belong to any fixed word classes.
Instead, the word class is determined by the word's place in the sentence.

For example, the word **hali** can function equally as an adjective (_blank_ or _void_), noun (_a blank_) and verb (_to make blank_ or _to get blank_).

**tu ha hali papir, he?**
– Do you have some blank paper?  
**don mi un hali!**
– Give me a blank!  
**tu mus hali vo lexi.**
– You must blank out that word.

Likewise, the word **kitaba** can function as a verb (_to write_), a noun (_a writing_) and adjective (_written_ or _textual_).

**mi kitaba letre.**
– I write a letter.  
**letre e kitaba misaje.**
– A letter is a written message.  
**mi luba tu su kitaba.**
– I love your writings.


## Compound Words

A compound word is a word that is formed of two or more simpler words in order to yield a new meaning.
Compound words can be made in two ways in Pandunia.

1. Open compounds are written as separate words. Ex.
   **tomato** 'tomato' + **sos** 'sauce** = **tomato sos** 'tomato sauce'.
2. Closed compounds are joined to form a single word. Ex.
   **poste** 'mail' + **kan** 'place for working, office, workshop, etc.' = **postekan** 'post office',
   **mei** 'beautiful' + **ta** 'quality' = **meita** 'beauty'.

There is little difference between these two ways, open compounds and closed compounds.
In principle, open compounds may be written together as closed compounds,
and closed compounds may be written separately as open compounds.
Both ways can work well.
However, normally *affixes* (that are listed below) are written together into closed compounds
and other joined words are written as open compounds.


## Affixes

Affixes, i.i. prefixes and suffixes, are very important and give great flexibility to the language.
They are joined to the base word.

Two or more roots can be put together to make _compound words_.
The last root is the most meaningful part in the compound
and the preceding roots only modify its meaning.

           pan       'all'
       +  demi       'people, public'
       +    li       'adjectival suffix'
    _____________
    = pandemili      'pandemic'

The connecting vowel **-o-** is inserted between words in Greek compounds.

           demi      'people, public'
       +  krati      'rule, govern'
       +     -a      'collective noun suffix'
    _____________
    = demikratia     'democracy'

          termi      'temperature'
       +  metre      'measure'
       +     -r      'agent or apparatus'
    ____________
    = termimetrer     'thermometer'

Pandunia has adopted international prefixes,
including **a-**, **de-**, **pro-**, **re-** and **su-** among others,
in order to re-create many international words as native Pandunia words.

             a-      'to, toward'
       +   ces-      'pass'
    ____________
    =     acese      'get past to, access'

           pro-      'forward, to the front'
       +   ces-      'pass'
    ____________
    =   procese      'pass forward, process'

            re-      'back to'
       +   ces-      'pass'
    ____________
    =    recese      'pass back, recede'

            de-      'away, off'
       +   ces-      'pass'
    ____________
    =    decese      'pass away, die'

            su-      'good, well'
       +   ces-      'pass'
    ____________
    =    sucese      'go well, succeed'

Note that these prefixes are used only in compound words that really mean the sum their parts.
Fossilized words whose meanings are no longer the sum of their parts,
like *evolution* (originally 'rolling out') and *revolution* (originally 'rolling back'),
are not compound words in Pandunia.
