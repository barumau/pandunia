# The basics of Pandunia

Pandunia is a constructed language that has a minimalistic grammar and a globalistic vocabulary.

### Letters and sounds

Pandunia uses a systematic spelling where
each letter represents one spoken sound.

> A B CH D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S SH T U V X Y Z

The vowels **a, e, i, o, u** are pronounced as in "are there three or two".

The consonants are:
**b**,
**ch** (sounds like _ch_ in _church_),
**d**,
**f**,
**g** (always hard),
**h**,
**j**,
**k**,
**l**,
**m**,
**n**,
**p**,
**r** (never silent),
**s** (always voiceless),
**t**,
**v** (sounds like _w_),
**sh** (sounds like _sh_),
**y**,
**z**.

### Never changing words

Words don't ever inflect or change in Pandunia
– not even when they change their word class!
The same word, without any change in form, can serve as a noun, adjective or verb.

### Personal pronouns

| Person   | Singular          | Plural       |
|:---------|:-----------------:|:------------:|
|          | **mi**            | **vi**       |
| 1st      | _I, me_           | _we, us_     |
|          | **tu**            | **yu**       |
| 2nd      | _you_             | _you all_    |
|          | **da**            | **di**       |
| 3rd      | _he/she, him/her_ | _they, them_ |

### Basic sentence structures

The basic word order is subject–verb–object
– the same as in English!

**mi love tu.**
– I love you.

Grammar words help to distinguish the subject, verb and object.
Subject and object are noun phrases and they frequently begin with a grammar word,
such as a demonstrative pronoun, numeral or another determiner.
The verb is a verb phrase and it frequently begins with a grammar word,
such as an affirmative or negative particle, an auxiliary verb or a marker of tense, aspect or mood.

Example 1. Structurally unclear sentence.

    mau yam fish.
    cat eat fish
    'The cat eats fish.' (probable interpretation of the meaning)
    
Example 2. Structurally clear sentence with the affirmation of the verb.

    mau ye  yam fish.
    cat yes eat fish
    'The cat does eat fish.'

Example 3. Structurally clear sentence with the negation of the verb.

    mau no  yam fish.
    cat no  eat fish
    'The cat doesn't eat fish.'

Example 4. A complex but structurally clear sentence.

    mi se frende  haf    yam un  pai.
    me 's friend  ASPECT eat one pie
    'My friend has eaten a pie.'


### Negation

To negate a word, add **no** before it.

**mi no sona.**
– I don't sleep.  
**tu yam no von.**
– You eat no-one.

### To be

The verb
**es**
means 'to be'.
It can be left out in very simple sentences.

**mi es home.**
– I am a human.  
**mi – home.**
– I'm a human.

It can't be left out when it is part of a serial verb.

**mi van es mau.**
– I want to be a cat.  
**mi van mau!**
– I want a cat!

### Multi-purpose words

Pandunia words can be ambiguous because they often have more meanings compared to English.

**da ye love mau.**
– He loves cats. / She loved a cat. / He/she will love the cat.

But actually the meaning is clear in the real context:

**pre tri nen, mi have du mau e un vaf. mi have plus un fem ben. da ye love mau!**
– Three years ago, I had two cats and a dog. I also had a daughter. _She loved the cats!_

### Time

Tenses and aspects are optionally expressed with the help of adverbs and auxiliary verbs,
like the aspect auxiliaries
**bi**
(be in the process of), and
**haf**
(have completed),
and the tense auxiliaries
**did**
(in the past), and
**vil**
(in the future).

**mi bi love tu.**
– I am loving you.  
**mi haf love tu.**
– I have loved you.  
**mi did love tu.**
– I loved you.  
**mi vil love tu.**
– I will love you.

### Passive

The passive voice is formed with the help of the helping verb
**be**.

**tu be love.**
– You are loved.  
**mi be love of tu.**
– I am loved by you.

### Modifying other words

To modify a noun, put adjectives before it.

**un nove love**
– a new love  
**da hau pai**
– the good pie

To modify a verb, put adverbs before it.
The adverb can be tagged with
**li**.

**mi gud (li) vize tu.**
– I see you well.  
**tu vize li love da.**
– You seemingly love him/her.

Modifiers are compared with
**mor**
'more, -er',
**mor... of hol**
'the most... (of all)',
**les**
'less',
**les... of hol**
'the least... (of all)', and
**sim**
'equally, as'.
The point of comparison is introduced with
**dan**
'than, as'.

**tu es mor yun dan mi.**
– You are younger than me.  
**tu es mor yun dan hol.**
– You are the youngest of all.

### Questions

To ask _yes–or–no_ questions, replace the verb with "(verb) **no** (verb)" pattern or add
**he**
'eh, huh' to the end of the sentence.

**tu vize no vize mi?**
– Do you see me?  
**tu vize mi, he?**
– You see me, eh?

To ask a content question, write a normal sentence and replace the word in question with
**kua**
'what, who'.

**tu love kua?**
– Who do you love?  
**tu love kua man?**
– Which man do you love?  
**kua man ye love tu?**
– Which man loves you?  
**tu love da kua li muche?**
– How much do you love him?

### Commands

To state a command, leave out the subject and start the sentence with the verb.

**yam da pai!**
– Eat that pie!  
**vize da mau!**
– Look at that cat!
