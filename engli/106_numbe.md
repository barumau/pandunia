# Numerals

## Cardinal numbers

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words.
They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

**un sing**
– one star  
**du sing**
– two stars  
**tri sing**
– three stars  
**shau sing**
– few stars  
**ba sing**
– many stars

**un dai kursi**
– one big chair  
**du dai kursi**
– two big chairs  
**tri bon kursi**
– three good chairs

The basic number words are:

- 0 **siro**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **du**
- 3 **tri**
- 4 **chatre**
- 5 **penta**
- 6 **luku**
- 7 **sete**
- 8 **bato**
- 9 **tisa**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another –
exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un siro** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un du**
- 13 **un tri**
- 20 **du siro** or **du des**
- 21 **du un**
- 22 **du du**
- 100 **un siro siro** or **cen**
- 101 **un siro uno** or **cen un**
- 200 **du siro siro** or **du cen**

Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units.
So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1 000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    
Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about.
For example, the word **sol** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one sun in the solar system.


## Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers are created with the particle **me**.

- **un me**
  – first
- **du me**
  – second
- **tri me**
  – third
- **chatre me**
  – fourth
- **penta me**
  – fifth
- **luku me**
  – sixth
- **sete me**
  – seventh
- **bato me**
  – eighth
- **tisa me**
  – ninth
- **des me**
  – tenth

They are placed before the modified noun like normal adjectives.

**un me fen**
– the first part  
**du me fen**
– the second part  
**tri me fen**
– the third part


## Fractions

Fractions are formed with the help of the ordinal particle
**me**.

**un du me**
– a half, ½  
**un chatre me**
– a fourth, a quarter, ¼  
**tri chatre me**
– three fourths, three quarters, ¾  
**un cen me**
– a hundredth, a percent, %  
**un kilo me**
– a thousandth, a permille, ‰

Note that it is siginificant where **me** is placed.

**un du me hor**
– a half hour  
**un me du hor**
– the first two hours

**du tri me pai**
– two thirds of a pie  
**du me tri pai**
– the second (batch of) three pies


## Date and time

#### Days of the week

In naming the days of the week, a number indicating the day (starting from Monday) is followed by
the ordinal particle
**me**
and
**den**
which means the period of 24 hours.
So 'Monday' is literally 'first-day', 'Tuesday' is 'second-day', 'Wednesday' is 'third-day', etc.

1. **un me den**
   – Monday
2. **du me den**
   – Tuesday
3. **tri me den**
   – Wednesday
4. **chatre me den**
   – Thursday
5. **penta me den**
   – Friday
6. **luku me den**
   – Saturday
7. **sete me den**
   – Sunday

#### Months

The names of months are made like the names of days
but this time the word
**mes**
("month") is used.

1. **un me mes**
   – January
2. **du me mes**
   – February
3. **tri me mes**
   – March
4. **chatre me mes**
  – April
5. **penta me mes**
  – May
6. **luku me mes**
  – June
7. **sete me mes**
  – July
8. **bato me mes**

9. **tisa me mes**
