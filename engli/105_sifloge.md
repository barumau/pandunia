# Adjectives

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to another word,
for example good, bad, big, and fast.

## Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun.
In Pandunia, adjectives typically end in **-i** and their place is before a noun.

**novi gare**
– new car(s)  
**rapidi gare**
– fast car(s)  
**dayi meze**
– big table(s)  
**gawi meze**
– high table(s)  
**boni kurse**
– good chair(s)

Two or more adjectives can modify the same word.

**lili novi gare**
– a little, new car

Adjective can be also after the noun.
Often this type of phrases can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

**gare novi.**
– The car is new.  
**bagre rapidi.**
– The tiger is fast.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

**novi gare rapidi.**
– The new car is fast.
