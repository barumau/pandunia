# Verbs

## Verb types

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.

A verb can involve an agent and a recipient.
The agent performs or "causes" an action,
and the recipient receives or "experiences" the action.

Pandunia has three verb types:
verbs that end in **-a**, verbs that end in **-u** and verbs that end in **-i**.
The endings decide the order of the agent and the recipient of the action in the sentence.
So the sentence structure depends on the type of the verb.

Simply put, the ending **-a** means:  
If there is anything right before the verb, it is the agent.  
If there is anything right after the verb, it is the recipient.

The ending **-u** means:  
If there is anything right before the verb, it is the recipient.  
If there is anything right after the verb, it is the agent.

And finally, the ending **-i** means
that the subject is in the state denoted by the verb root.

Consider the following examples:  
**me safa.**
– I clean.  
**me safa kamare.**
– I clean a room.  
**kamare safu.**
– The room is cleaned.  
**kamare safu me.**
– The room is cleaned by me.  
**kamare safi.**
– The room is clean.

As you can see, **-a** and **-u** indicate word orders that are opposite to each other.
Verbs that end in **-a** are active
and verbs that end in **-u** are called passive.

### Active verbs

Verbs that end in **-a** are called _active verbs_.

In active sentences, the focus is on the doer (i.e. the agent) of the action.
So the sentence word order is subject–verb–object.

**feme kitaba buke.**  
– The woman writes a book.

The subject of an active verb is the doer or the agent
who does the action that the verb indicates.
The action is done to the object,
which is the passive recipient of the action.

Examples:  
**te vida ke?**
– You see what?  
**me vida lole.**
– I see them.  
**te beka pang.**
– You bake bread.  


### Passive verbs

Verbs that end in **-u** are called _passive verbs_.
The sentence word order is again subject–verb–object,
but the roles of subject and object are different than with active verbs.

In passive sentences, the focus is on the recipient of the action.
The action is done to the recipient, which is the subject,
and the object is the source or the agent of the action.

**buke kitabu.**  
– The book gets written.

Often passive sentences in Pandunia can be translated to English
by using the passive voice or an intransitive verb
but sometimes a transitive verb can be used too.

Examples:  
**pang beku te.**
– Bread is baked by you.  
**pakse domisu arbe.**
– Birds are housed by trees.  
**te suku me.**
– You are pleased by me. (Or: You like me.)


### Stative verbs

Verbs that end in **-i** are called _stative verbs_.
They are basically adjectives that describe the subject in a verb-like manner.
The subject of a stative verb is in the state denoted by the verb root.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/kitabi.png "buke kitabi.")  
**buke kitabi.**  
– The book is written.

Stative verbs differ from passive verbs by the fact that
a stative verb is about being in a state
whereas a passive verb indicates a change of state.
In other words, a stative verb is a _passive of being_
and a passive verb is a _passive of becoming_.



### Summary of the verb types

The verb types are summarized in the table below.

## Prepositions

In Pandunia, prepositions are basically a sub-category of verbs.

### Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has four prepositions of place and time.

1. **sa** - presence, location or moment (in general): with, at, in,
   on, by, during, while
2. **na** - absence or lack: without
3. **ca** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
4. **pa** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

**me sa hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
**me sona sa hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
**me sona ca xam pa sube.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
**me safara ca london pa paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

**me denga ca te gowa.** - I have waited since you left.  
**me denga pa te laya dome.** - I wait until you come home.  
**me denga sa te sona.** - I wait while you sleep.  

#### sa

**sa** is an all-purpose preposition. Its basic meaning is "with".
 
**me libu sa dome.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**me loga sa pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**me loga sa doste sa pandunia sa fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia by telephone.

#### Verbs as prepositions

In Pandunia some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

**me kata pang.** - I cut bread.  
**me kata pang, uza caku.** - I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

**me denga dura dul hor.** - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

**bada** - to follow; after, behind  
**dura** - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
**jungu** - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
**loka** - to occupy, to be located; at  
**sirka** - to surround; around  
**supra** - to surpass; over, above  

#### Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

**me laya dome.** - I come home.  
**te sida kurse.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
**le lala sofa'.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
**fix nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
**jenger marca daw.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

### Preposition of relation

Preposition **ko** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to
English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

**me jana pandunia ko gur.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**ko** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In
the above example **jana** (know) is the verb and **gur** (master) is
the point of comparison.

**ko** is also used when adjectives are compared.

**bace si min day ko pape.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
**law pape si samo day ko pape.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**ko** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min**
(less) and **samo** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is
**pape** (father) in the examples above.
