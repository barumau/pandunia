# Verbs

## Verb types

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.

A verb can involve an agent and a recipient.
The agent performs or "causes" an action,
and the recipient receives or "experiences" the action.

There are three types of verbs in Pandunia:

1. Active: The subject does the action.
   The the verb ends in **-a**.
2. Passive: The subject receives the action.
   The verb ends in **-u**.
3. Stative: The subject is in the state that is indicated by the verb.
   The verb ends in **-i**.

Consider the following examples:  
**me safa.**
– I clean. (active verb)  
**me safa kamar.**
– I clean a room. (active verb with an object)  
**kamar safu.**
– The room is cleaned. (passive verb)  
**kamar safu me.**
– The room is cleaned by me. (passive verb with an object)  
**kamar safi.**
– The room is clean. (stative verb)

As you can see, **-a** and **-u** indicate opposite orders for the agent and recipient.


### Active verbs

Verbs that end in **-a** are called _active verbs_.
In the active voice,
the subject does the action,
and the object receives the action of the verb.
The word order is subject–verb–object.

| Subject | Verb     | Object    |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **maw** | **yama** | **mush.** |
| Cats    | eat      | mice.     |


In active sentences, the focus is on the doer of the action.

**fem kitaba buke.**  
– The woman writes a book.

The subject of an active verb is the doer or the agent
who does the action that the verb indicates.
The action is done to the object,
which is the passive recipient of the action.

Examples:  
**te vida ke?**
– You see what?  
**me vida lole.**
– I see them.  
**te beka pang.**
– You bake bread.  


### Passive verbs

Verbs that end in **-u** are called _passive verbs_.
(They could be also called _mediopassive verbs_.)
The sentence word order is the normal subject–verb–object,
but this time
the subject receives the action,
and the object (if there is one) does the action of the verb.

| Subject  | Verb      | Object    |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **mush** | **yamu**  | **maw.**  |
| Mice     | are eaten | by cats.  |

When a passive verb is used, the focus is on the recipient of the action.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/kitabu.png "buke kitabu.")  
**buke kitabu.**  
– The book is written.

See how the object of the active verb becomes the subject of the passive verb:

| Subject    | Verb       | Object        |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| **fem**    | **kitaba** | ***buke.***   |
| The woman  | writes     | _the book_.   |
| ***buke*** | **kitabu** | **fem.**      |
| _The book_ | is written | by the woman. |

In Pandunia, a passive verb is used when:

1. The subject receives an action,
   ex. **kitabu** (to be written), **darbu** (to get hit).
2. The subject undergoes a change of state,
   ex. **parchu** (to get broken), **novu** (to become new).
3. The subject moves to another place,
   ex. **layu** (to come), **marchu** (to walk).
3. The subject is influenced or stimulated by the object,
   ex. **suku** (to be pleased), **fobu** (to be scared)

Sometimes a passive verb is used in Pandunia when an active verb would be used in English
because of the last point.
For example, desire is stimulated by the object of desire,
so the corresponding verb **volu** (_to want or desire_) is "passive" in Pandunia.
Likewise, joy and pleasure are stimulated by the source of joy,
so the corresponding verb **suku** (_to enjoy or like_) is also "passive"
– as it can also be in English (_to be pleased by_)!

**me volu novi jupe.**
– I desire a new skirt.  
**me suku boni yam.**
– I enjoy good food. OR
I am pleased by good food.


### Stative verbs

Verbs that end in **-i** are called _stative verbs_.
They are basically adjectives that describe the subject in a verb-like manner.
The subject of a stative verb is in the state denoted by the verb root.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/kitabi.png "buke kitabi.")  
**buke kitabi.**  
– The book is written.

Stative verbs differ from passive verbs by the fact that
a stative verb is about being in a state
whereas a passive verb indicates a change of state.
In other words, a stative verb is a _passive of being_
and a passive verb is a _passive of becoming_.

Stative verbs are always intransitive.
They can't have an object.
For example, see how the verbs about
**fuke**
(clothes or clothing) work.

**me fuki.**
– I am clothed. OR I am dressed.  
**me fuku sapate.**
– I wear shoes.  
**le fuka sapate pa me.**
– He or she puts shoes on me.

So, as a verb,
**fuki**
means _to be clothed or dressed_
and, as an adjective, _clothed, dressed_.

**fuki ren abla restu jivi va lengia.**
– A clothed person can stay alive in the cold.

## Participles

**-an-**
denotes someone or something that does the action of the root.
It is the active participle suffix.

**loga**
– to speak  
**logani**
– speaking  
**logane**
– the one who speaks

**-it-**
denotes someone or something that undergoes the action of the root.
It is the passive participle suffix.

**loga**
– to speak  
**logiti**
– spoken  
**padu**
– to fall  
**paditi**
– fallen  
**una**
to unite
→ **uniti**

### Causative verbs

The causatives are the verbs that are used to indicate
that one person causes another person to do something.
It can be by asking, paying, requesting, or forcing the person.

Sometimes the simple active verb is causative.

**Tomas pada Yusef.**
– Thomas drops Yusef.  
**Yusef padu.**
– Yusef falls.

In other situations, the causative is formed by using one of the participle suffixes.
**-ana** means that someone causes someone to do something.
**-ita** means that someone causes something to be done to someone or something.

**Sara padana Tomas.**
– Sara causes Thomas to drop (something).  
**Sara padita Yusef.**
– Sara causes Yusef to be dropped.

Here is a more complete example.
Note that "to feed" has two different causative meanings in English.

**pesh yamu.**
– Fish is eaten.  
**maw yama pesh.**
– The cat eats fish.  
**me yamita pesh pa maw.**
– I feed fish to the cat.  
**me yamana maw a pesh.**
– I feed the cat with fish.

A causative can imply that the action is done for the causer.

**me no bina dom. me binita le.**
– I don't build the house. I have it built (for myself).


## Prepositions

In Pandunia, prepositions are basically a sub-category of verbs.

### Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has five prepositions of place and time.

1. **ya** - presence or togetherness:
   with, by use of
2. **na** - absence or lack: without
3. **va** - location or moment (in general):
   at, in, on, by
4. **ja** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
5. **pa** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

**me va hotel.**
– I'm in the hotel.  
**me sona va hotel.**
– I sleep in the hotel.  
**me sona ja sham pa sube.**
– I sleep since evening until morning.  
**me safara ja London pa Paris.**
– I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

**me denga ja te kita.**
– I have waited since you left.  
**me denga pa te laya dom.**
– I wait until you come home.  
**me denga va te sona.**
– I wait while you sleep.  

#### va

**va** is an all-purpose locative preposition.
Its basic meaning is "at".
 
**me libu va dome.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**me loga va pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**me loga ya doste va pandunia va fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia by telephone.

#### Verbs as prepositions

In Pandunia some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

**me kata pang.**
– I cut bread.  
**me kata pang, uza chake.**
– I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

**me denga dura dul hor.** - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

**bada** - to follow; after, behind  
**dura** - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
**jungu** - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
**loka** - to occupy, to be located; at  
**sirka** - to surround; around  
**supra** - to surpass; over, above  

#### Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

**me laya dome.**
– I come home.  
**te sida kurse.**
– You sit (on) the chair.  
**le lala sofa.**
– S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
**pex nata daria.**
– Fish swim (in) the sea.  
**jenger marcha daw.**
– Warriors march (on) the road.  

### Preposition of relation

Preposition **ka** indicates the way something is done.
It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

**me sava pandunia ka master.**
– I know Pandunia like a master.

**ka**
relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison.
In the above example
**sava**
(know) is the verb and
**master**
(master) is the point of comparison.

**ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

**pute sa min day ko pape.**
– The child is smaller than the father.  
**lawpape sa samo day ka pape.**
– Grandfather is as big as father.

**ka** relates the adverbs of comparison
– **max** (more), **min** (less) and **samo** (same) –
to the point of comparison, which is **pape** (father) in the examples above.
