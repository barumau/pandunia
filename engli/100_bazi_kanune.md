# The basic rules of Pandunia

These are the basic rules of Pandunia language.
They are described in more detail later in this document.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
   Every word is read as it is written.
   No letter is silent.
   Only the small letters are required.
2. The stress accent is on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. The personal pronons are:
   **mo**
   – I,
   **ni**
   – only you,
   **ta**
   – he or she,
   **momen**
   – we,
   **nimen**
   – you all,
   **tamen**
   – they,
   **men**
   – one (_impersonal pronoun_)
4. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
   Their form is not affected by number, gender or case.
   They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.
5. Adjectives come before the noun that they modify.
    - **loge**
      – speech,
      **bon loge**
      – good speech,
      **dus loge**
      – bad speech
6. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs and complete sentences.
   They come before the word that they modify or very last in the sentence.
   All adverbs consist of a _grade adverb_ and an adjective.
    - **tre bon**
      – very good or very well
    - **ta tre bon loge.**
      = **le loge tre bon.**
      – He or she speaks very well.
7. The normal word order is subject–verb–object.
    - **mo ai ni.**
      – I love you.
    - **mo loge la pandunia.**
      – I speak Pandunia.
8. A passive sentence is created with the help of the passive auxiliary verb **be**.
   A similar effect can be also reached with the impersonal pronoun **men**.
    - **pandunia be loge.**
      – Pandunia is spoken.
    - **men loge la pandunia.**
      – One speaks Pandunia.
9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb
   functions as the subject of the following verb.
    - **mo cing ni loge la pandunia.**
      – I ask you to speak Pandunia.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **_mo_ cing _ni_ loge la pandunia.** → **cing loge la pandunia.**
      – Please speak Pandunia.
11. Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them.
   The main word stands at the end.
    - **poste**
      ("mail") +
      **kasa**
      ("box") =
      **poste kasa**
      ("mailbox")
