Introducing yourself
--------------------

### Dialog

<big>👩</big>
**te si ke?**
= Who are you?  
<big>🧔</big>
**me si yusef. te si ke?**
= I am Yusef. Who are you?  
<big>👩</big>
**me si maria. le si ke?**
= I am Maria. Who is that?  
<big>🧔</big>
**le si mi doste.**
= That is my friend.  
<big>👩</big>
**li nam si ke?**
= What's her name?  
<big>🧔</big>
**li nam si sarah.**
= Her name is Sarah.

### Grammar

Pandunia's sentences normally follow the topic-comment structure. 
The topic indicates who or what is being talked about. The comment
tells something about the topic. For instance in **le si mi doste**
the topic is the pronoun **le** (he, she, it), which is followed by
the comment **si mi doste** (is my friend).

In Pandunia, the word **si** functions like _to be_ in English.
The same word is used for all persons. And to say the opposite, 
simply replace it with **no** (which is the word for _no_).

**le si sarah.**
= She is Sarah.  
**le no sarah.**
= She is not Sarah.

**maw si hewan.**
= The cat is an animal.  
**dome no hewan.**
= The house is not an animal.  

In the same way you can describe yourself by saying **me** and a word
that describes you.

**me bon.**
= I'm good.  
**me man.**
= I'm a man.  
**me fem.**
= I'm a woman.

## Saying hello

**salam**
= Hello!

This is how people greet each other in Pandunia. They say **salam**.
It is used for saying both hello and goodbye.

**salam**
= Bye!

The word **salam** means "greeting". It is originally an Arabic word,
which means _peace_, and it is a common greeting in many parts of the
world, especially in Africa and Asia. Pandunia is a constructed world
language, which borrows words from all parts of the world.

The verb form of **salam** is **salama**, which means "to greet".

**me salama te.**
= I greet you.  
**te salama me.**
= You greet me.

These are active sentences. In active sentences the subject does the
action to the object. In **me salama te** the first word, **me**, is
the subject, **salama** is the verb (action word), and **te** is the
object. The order of subject, verb and object is the normal word order
in Pandunia.

> Word order in active sentence: Subject + Verb + Object

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **me** = I, **te** = you, and
**le** = he, she, it. Note that the pronouns stayed the same in the
previous example sentences. Words never change in Pandunia. They
always stay the same regardless of their position in sentence.

In Pandunia sentences can be made shorter by leaving out pronouns
that are obvious in the present situation.

**me salama te!**
= I greet you.  
**salama te!**
= Greetings to you! (It is obvious that the speaker is the one who greets.)  
**salama!**
= Greeting! (It is obvious that the listeners are greeted.)  
**salam!**
= Hello!

The pattern in **salam te** is convenient for addressing people by
name, kinship term or profession.

**salam toni!**
= Hello, Tony!  
**salam mame!**
= Hello, mother!  
**salam pape!**
= Hello, father!  
**salam xefe!**
= Hello, chief!

Another Pandunia word for greeting is **halow**. It is also a very
international greeting. You can choose freely, which word to use when
you greet people.

**halow!**
= Hello!

## Making requests

### Dialog

<big>🧒</big>
**salam!**
= Hello!  
<big>🧓</big>
**salam! pliza sida.**
= Hello! Please sit!  
<big>🧒</big>
**danke.**
= Thank you.  
<big>🧓</big>
**pliza niama kafe o cay.**
= Please have some coffee or tea.  
<big>🧒</big>
**me niama cay. danke.**
= I will have some tea, thank you.  
...  
<big>🧓</big>
**pliza salama ti mame!**
= Please tell greetings to your mother.  
<big>🧒</big>
**me salama le. salam reste!**
= I will. Bye!  
<big>🧓</big>
**salam cute!**
= Bye!


### Grammar

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **me** = I, **te** = you, and
**le** = he, she, it. Pandunia is a gender-neutral language. It
doesn't distinguish between sexes in the third person pronoun or any
of the pronouns. All the personal pronouns are present in the
following example sentence.

**me pliza te salama le.**
= I ask you to say hello to him/her.

This sentence has a _pivot structure_. The first verb, **pliza** = to
request, addresses **te** as its object. At the same time **te**
serves also as the subject of the second verb, **salama** = to greet,
whose object is **le**. So **te** has a double role: (1) object of
the first verb and (2) subject of the second verb. Hence, it is the
_pivot_ or hinge between the two verbs.

> Pivot Stucture: Subject + Verb¹ + Object/Subject + Verb² + Object

The pivot structure is a common structure in Pandunia.

Remember that it is allowed to leave out pronouns that are known in
the context. In other words the speaker can safely assume that the
listeners know who he or she is talking about. So it is unnecessary
to keep on repeating them. In this manner phrases can be made shorter.

**me pliza te salama le.**
= I ask you to say hello to him/her.  
**pliza salama le.**
= Please say hello to him/her.

See how the translation of **pliza** changed between the two sentences?
The meaning of the word, the concept, did not change, but its use did.
English reflects this change by using different words, to ask and please.
Pandunia can cope with changes like this without resorting to different
words. It is a principle in Pandunia that there is always exactly one
word for one concept. Different words are not created just because the
grammatical role of a concept changes.

The phrase **pliza salama le** has a useful pattern that can be used
for making polite requests.

**pliza sida.**
= Please be seated.  
**pliza dona kafe.**
= Please give me some coffee.  
**pliza dona cay.**
= Please give me some tea.  
**pliza niama cay.**
= Please have some tea.  
**pliza safa kamare.**
= Please clean the room.

Commands are introduced with **komanda** = to command. They employ the
same pivot structure as requests with **pliza**.

**komanda dona cay.**
= Give (me) some tea!  
**komanda safa kamare.**
= Clean the room!

In practice, direct commands can be also made with just one verb and
a commanding voice.

**safa le!**
= Clean it!

### Asking questions

Questions that can be answered by saying _yes_ or _no_ have the same
pivot structure as requests with **pliza**, which you learned in the
previous lesson. Question sentences are introduced with **eska** = to ask.

**me eska te niama cay.**
= I ask (do) you drink tea.  
**eska te niama cay?**
= Do you drink tea?  
**eska niama cay?**
= Drink tea?

Requests usually concern the one or the ones spoken to, but questions
are often about other people. Therefore the second pronoun is usually
needed. It can be left out only when it is clear who is the topic of
discussion.

**eska le niama cay?**
= Does he or she drink tea?  
**eska te niama supe?**
= Do you eat soup?  
**eska mome niama suy?**
= Do we drink water?

Of course common and proper nouns can also be used.

**eska xefe niama kafe?**
= Does the chief drink coffee?  
**eska pape safa kamare?**
= Does the father clean the room?  
**eska niki baxa pandunia?**
= Does Nicky speak Pandunia?


### Giving answers

Yes/no questions can be answered with **si** = yes, and **no** = no.

– **eska te niama supe?**
= Do you eat soup?  
– **si.**
= Yes.  
– **eska le niama supe?**
= Does she eat soup?  
– **no.**
= No.

Also more complete answers can be given.

= Yes, I drink coffee.  
– **eska le niama kafe?**

= No, he doesn't drink coffee.

It is also possible to answer yes by repeating the main verb of the question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Saying no
---------

In the previous lesson you learned to answer **si** and **no** to
questions. The word **no** is used for denying something. Adding
**no** in front of the verb turns an affirmative sentence to negative.

**me salama te.**
= I greet you.  
**me no salama te.**
= I do not greet you.

Conceptually negation means the absence or non-existence of the
negated word. In the phrase **me no salama te** the negative word
**no** denies the existence of greeting.

In Pandunia the negative word affects the word that follows it.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location
of the negative word.

**me pliza te safa kamare.**
= I ask you to clean the room.  
**me no pliza te safa kamare.**
= I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**me pliza te no safa kamare.**
= I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The negated word can be of any type: verb, pronoun, noun, adjective
and even numeral.

**le no tena maw.**
= She doesn't have a cat.  
**le tena no maw, a waf.**
= She has no cats but dogs.  
**no le, a me tena maw.**
= Not she but I have cats.  
**me tena no un, a duli maw.**
= I have not one but two cats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## More Questions

To ask questions beginning with _what_, _which_, _how_, _who_ and
_when_, the interrogative pronoun **ki** is normally used. The
question can be made more specific by adding words for person, time,
manner or thing if needed.

**le si ke?**
= What is that? / Who is (s)he?  
**ki ren laya?**
= Who is coming? (**ren** = person)  
**ki zaman te niama?**
= When do you eat? (**zaman** = time)  
**ki yang dansa?**
= How to dance? (**yang** = manner, style)

In Pandunia, questions beginning with _why_ are asked using
**ke saba**.

**ke saba te suku maw?**
= Why do you like cats?

Questions asking about the cause or reason of something, are answered
by adding **sabu** before the cause or reason. **sabu** is actually a
passive verb meaning _to be caused by_.

**ke saba te suku maw?**
= Why do you like cats?  
**sabu lole kaway.**
= Because they are cute.

Of course **sabu** can also be used to express the cause or reason for
something, even when not answering to a question.

**me suku maw sabu lole kaway**
= I like cats because they are cute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Past, present and future

### Expressing time

There are no verb conjugations in Pandunia. All verbs have only one
form for all times. In a way they are similar to some English verbs,
such as "to hit", which is the same in all tenses.

**me darba le.**
= I hit it.

In Pandunia all verbs are like that! For example, **me niama pang**
can mean both "I eat bread" and "I ate bread", but usually only one
or the other meaning makes sense in the context of the discussion.
For example when people talk about that morning's breakfast, the
sentence tells about the past time.

**me niama pang sa subi niam.**
= I ate bread for morning meal.

There are also specific time words.

**gango**
= just, recently  
**zayo**
= currently, at the moment  
**yexo**
= still, yet  
**suno**
= soon  
**wilo**
= later, in the future



The adjectives for past, present and future are **pas, zay** and
**wil**. They can be used for modifying nouns.

**sarah si mi pasi xefe.**
= Sarah is my former boss.  
**yusef si mi zayi xefe.**
= Yusef is my current boss.  
**maria si mi wili xefe.**
= Maria is my future boss.

The same words are used when you talk about actions and events in time.
Simply put the word before the verb.

**me paso darba le.**
= I hit it (in the past).  
**me zayo darba le.**
= I am hitting it (currently).  
**me wilo darba le.**
= I will hit it (in the future).

Alternatively the time word can be placed last in the sentence.

**me darba le paso.**  
**me darba le zayo.**  
**me darba le wilo.**

It's also possible to use longer phrases like **sa pase** (in the past) etc.

**me darba le sa pase.**
= I hit it in the past.  
**me darba le sa zaye.**
= I hit it at present.  
**me darba le sa wile.**
= I hit it in the future.


It is not necessary to repeat the time expressions all the time. It
would be awkward. It is enough to set the stage once in the beginning
with a time expression. Another time word will not be needed until
the tense changes or until it becomes useful to stress that you are
still talking in the same tense.

**me paso tena un maw.**
= I had a cat in the past.  
**le bon maw.**
= It was a good cat.  
**me tena un waf zayo.**
= I have a dog now.

Any expression of time is good for expressing the tense. When one
time expression is present, other markers are not needed.

**me jenu sa nen 2003.**
= I was born in 2003.  
**le safa kamare sa badi den.**
= He will clean the room tomorrow.
