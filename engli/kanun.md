# Grammar of Pandunia

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Introduction

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in Pandunia. 
However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading this grammar,
for example with the help of a phrasebook and a dictionary.

All language teachers know that a language becomes more difficult to learn
when the student must learn to make distinctions that they are not used to making.
That's why students have difficulties with things like
irregular spelling, case-inflection, mandatory tenses, tones, noun/adjective agreement,
honorific inflection, consonant and vowel harmony, mandatory gender distinctions and so on.

Pandunia is not a difficult language to learn.
It doesn't have any of the previously mentioned complexities.
Instead, it has a simple and regular grammar, a relatively simple vocabulary, and a simple phonetic spelling.

### 1.2. Word classes

A word class is a group of words that have similar forms and similar use in sentences.
In Pandunia, the word class is often indicated by the ending, especially the last vowel, of a word.
For example, most words that end in **-a** are used as verbs in sentences.

The two major families of word classes are content words and function words.
Content words convey most of information and meaning.
Function words are the necessary words for grammar.
You can't say anything meaningful without content words,
but you need function words to put content words together, especially in long sentences.

In Pandunia, the main classes of content words are: nouns, verbs and modifiers;
and the main classes of function words are: pronouns, determiners, prepositions and postpositions.

The vowel endings indicate the classes of content words as follows:

- **-e** indicates a noun
- **-i** indicates an adjective
- **-o** indicates an adverb
- **-a** indicates an active verb
- **-u** indicates a passive verb

For example, **log-** is the stem for the noun **loge** (_speech_),
the adjective **logi** (_spoken_ or _oral_), the adverb **logo** (_orally_),
the active verb **loga** (_to speak_), and the passive verb **logu** (_to be spoken_).

The same vowel endings are used also in function words,
and they indicate the classes of function words as follows:

- **-e** indicates a pronoun
- **-i** indicates a determiner
- **-o** indicates an adverb
- **-a** indicates a preposition
- **-u** indicates a postposition

For example, **k-** is the stem for the interrogative pronoun **ke** (_what_),
the adverb **ko** (_how_) and the determiner **ki** (_which_).

Cardinal numerals don't have any vowel ending.

Proper names are considered to be independent of the stem-and-suffix system in Pandunia.
That's why they don't always have the normal word class endings.
For example, the name of a person called _Marie_ can be **mari** in Pandunia,
and the word shall function as a noun and not as a modifier unlike the form of the word indicates.
Obviously, this can be confusing.
That's why it is recommended that names are modified to use the normal noun endings
or to take the honorary suffix **san** as in **mari-san**.


### 1.3. The basic rules

These are the basic rules of Pandunia language.
They are described in more detail later in this document.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2. The stress is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Words consist of a stem and one or more suffixes.
   The last suffix indicates the word class to which the word belongs.
    - Adjectives end in **-i**, ex. **novi** = new.
    - Adverbs end in **-o**, ex. **novo** = newly.
    - Active verbs end in **-a**, ex. **me loga** = I speak.
    - Passive verbs end in **-u**, ex. **le logu** = It is spoken.
    - Nouns end in **-e**, **-ia** or a consonant.
4. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
5. Adjectives come before the word that they modify.
   All adjectives, except the most common few, end in **-i**.
    - ex. **rapidi loge** = Fast speech.
6. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs and complete sentences.
   They come before the word that they modify or very last in the sentence.
   All adverbs, except the most common few, end in **-o**.
    - ex. 1. **vero rapidi loge** = Very fast speech.
    - ex. 2. **te loga bono.** = You talk well.
7. The verb ending **-a** indicates that the verb is active
   and the agent of the action is immediately before the verb.
    - ex. **me niama aple.** = I eat apples.
8. The verb ending -u indicates that the verb is passive
   and the recipient of the action is immediately before the verb.
    - ex. **aple niamu.** = Apples are eaten.
9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb
   functions as the subject of the next verb.
    - ex. **me pliza te dona pes.** = I ask you to give money.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **me eska te baxa pandunia?** → **eska te baxa pandunia?** = Do
      you speak Pandunia?
    - **me pliza te loga mingo.** →  **pliza loga mingo.**
      = Please speak clearly.
11. Compound words are created by putting the word stems side by side.
    The linking vowel **-o-** is inserted between the stems.
    - ex. **hur-** (freedom) + **ist-** (proponent) → **huriste** (liberalist)
    - ex. **post-** (mail) + **sanduk-** (box) → **postosanduke** (mailbox)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Nouns

### 2.1. Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing.
Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant.
So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

**petre**
– a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
**meze**
– a table, tables, the table or the tables  
**kurse**
– a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
**suy**
– water

Number and definiteness are often known because they were specified earlier in the discussion or because they are general knowledge.
For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **lun** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and moon.

### 2.2. Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in singular and plural.
Number can be mentioned with number words when it is needed.

**kurse**
– a chair or chairs  
**un kurse**
– one chair  
**dul kurse**
– two chairs  
**tin kurse**
– three chairs  
**pol kurse**
– many chairs; chairs


### 2.3. Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine and/or neuter categories).

Some words have _natural gender_.
For example **fem** (woman) is feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to another word,
for example good, bad, big, and fast.

### 3.1. Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun.
In Pandunia, adjectives typically end in **-i** and their place is before a noun.

**novi kar**
– new car(s)  
**rapidi kar**
– fast car(s)  
**day meze**
– big table(s)  
**gawi meze**
– high table(s)  
**bon kurse**
– good chair(s)

Two or more adjectives can modify the same word.

**lil novi kar**
– a little, new car

Adjective can be also after the noun.
Often this type of phrases can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

**kar novi.**
– The car is new.  
**bagre rapidi.**
– The tiger is fast.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

**novi kar rapidi.**
– The new car is fast.

### 3.2 Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia adverbs end in **-o** and their place is before a verb
or at the end of the sentence.

**me _bono_ sona.**
– I well sleep.  
**me sona _bono_.**
– I sleep _well_.  
**te baxa pandunia _bono_.**
– You speak Pandunia _well_.

### 3.3. Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier.
For example **day** (big) and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

**day ren**
– a big person  
**lil ren**
– a little person  
**sundari ren**
– a beautiful person

**dayo sundari ren**
– very beautiful person  
**lilo sundari ren**
– somewhat beautiful person


### 3.4. Comparison

Modifiers can be compared.

- **max** (more) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim** (most) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min** (less) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim** (least) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **sam** (as) indicates the comparison of equality

Particle **ko** relates the adverbs of comparison to the point of comparison.

**me si max bon ko te.**
= I am better than you.  
**te loga sam bono ko me.**
= You speak as well as me.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Numerals

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words.
They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

**un xing**
– one star  
**dul xing**
– two stars  
**tin xing**
– three stars  
**xaw xing**
– few stars  
**pol xing**
– many stars

**un day kurse**
– one big chair  
**dul day kurse**
– two big chairs  
**tin bon kurse**
– three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

**fen un**
– the first part (part one)
**fen dul**
– the second part (part two)
**fen tin**
– the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nol**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **dul**
- 3 **tin**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **sem**
- 8 **bal**
- 9 **naw**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another –
exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nol** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un dul**
- 13 **un tin**
- 20 **dul nol**
- 21 **dul un**
- 22 **dul dul**
- 100 **un nol nol** or **hon**
- 101 **un nol un** or **hon un**
- 200 **dul nol nol** or **dul hon**

Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units.
So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1 000 **kil**
- 1 000 000 **megi**
- 1 000 000 000 **gigi**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **teri**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peti**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksi**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeti**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yoti**
    
Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about.
For example, the word **sol** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.


## 5. Pronouns

### 5.1. Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

**me**
– I, me  
**te**
– you  
**le**
– he, she, it  
**mome**
– we  
**tote**
– you all  
**lole**
– they

### 5.2. Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**ze**
– self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **ze** is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**me vida ze**
– I see myself.  
**le vida ze**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mome vida ze.**
– We see ourselves.

### 5.3. Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns are:

**ye**
– this one  
**we**
– that one

**me wana ye.**
– I want this one.  
**le wana we.**
– He/she wants that one.

They end in **-i** when they function as modifiers i.e. when they come before a noun.

**yi maw**
– This cat  
**wi maw**
– That cat

### 5.4. Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ki**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ki xey?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ki ren?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ki zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  
**ki yang?**
– How? (What manner?)

The adverbial interrogative pronoun is **ko**
and it means the same as English _how_.

Also adjectives are questioned with **ki**.

**ko novi?**
– How new?  
**ko kosti?**
– How costy?  
**ko pol?**
– How many?  
**ko day?**
– How big?  
**ko lil?**
– How small?

**te tena ko day maw?**
– How big cat do you have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Verbs

### 6.1. Introduction

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.

A verb can involve an agent and a recipient.
The agent performs or "causes" an action,
and the recipient receives or "experiences" the action.

Pandunia has two types of verb:
verbs that end in **-a** and verbs that end in **-u**.
The endings decide the order of the agent and the recipient of the action in the sentence.
So the sentence structure depends on the type of the verb.

Simply put, the ending **-a** means:  
If there is anything right before the verb, it is the agent.  
If there is anything right after the verb, it is the recipient.

And the ending **-u** means:  
If there is anything right before the verb, it is the recipient.  
If there is anything right after the verb, it is the agent.

Consider the following examples:  
**me safa.**
– I clean.  
**me safa kamar.**
– I clean a room.  
**kamar safu.**
– Room is cleaned.  
**kamar safu me.**
– Room is cleaned by me.

As you can see, **-a** and **-u** indicate word orders that are opposite to each other.
Verbs that end in **-a** are active
and verbs that end in **-u** are called passive.

### 6.2. Active verbs

Verbs that end in **-a** are called _active verbs_.
The sentence word order is subject–verb–object.

The subject of an active verb does the action that the verb indicates.
So it is the doer or the agent of the action.
The action is done to the object,
so the object is the passive recipient of the action.

Examples:  
**te vida ke?**
– You see what?  
**me vida lole.**
– I see them.  
**te beka pang.**
– You bake bread.  

### 6.3. Passive verbs

Verbs that end in **-u** are called _passive verbs_.
The sentence word order is again subject–verb–object,
but the actual roles of subject and object are different than with active verbs.

The subject of a passive verb receives or "suffers" the action, which is done to it,
and the object is the source of the action.

Often passive sentences in Pandunia can be translated to English
by using the passive voice or an intransitive verb
but sometimes a transitive verb can be used too.

Examples:  
**pang beku te.**
– Bread is baked by you.  
**pakse domu arbe.**
– Birds live (in) trees.  
**te suku me.**
– You are pleased by me. (Or: You like me.)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Sentences

### 7.1. Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type.
They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention.

**maw!**
– A cat!  
**barxa!**
– (It) rains!

### 7.2. Stative Sentences

#### 7.2.1. With noun or pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate.
In the simplest sentences, the subject is a noun or a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

**me bon.**
– I am good.  
**le novi.**
– It is new.  
**le sarah.**
– She is Sarah.  
**sarah bon.**
– Sarah is good.  
**petre day.**
– The stone is big.  
**meze novi.**
– The table is new.  

The word **no** is added to form the negative.

**me no bon.**
– I'm not good.  
**le no novi.**
– It's not new.  
**le no sarah.**
– She is not Sarah.

It is possible to add the word **si** (yes) before the predicate in positive sentences,
for style or for convenience.
Then the structure is similar like in negative sentences.

**sarah si bon.**
– Sarah is good.  
**petre si day.**
– The stone is big.  
**meze si novi.**
– The table is new.  
**meze no law.**
– The table is not old.

Also two personal pronouns can be combined with **si** and **no**.

**me si le.**
– I am he/she.  
**me no te.**
– I'm not you.

#### 7.2.2. With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

**jowan si sundar.**
– Young is beautiful.  
**novi no purani.**
– New is not old.  

#### 7.2.3. With verb subject

A verb can't be subject as such.
So the verb is first, use **ye** to start a comment about the verb.

**canta, ye bon.**
– Singing, that is good. (Singing is good.)

#### 7.2.4. To be

Pandunia doesn't use a verb like "to be" in English.


### 7.3. Active Sentences

An active sentence is a sentence where the subject does the action denoted by the verb to the object.
The focus is on the subject as the active counterpart.
The correct word order is subject-verb-object (SVO).

In Pandunia, active verbs are easy to identify because all of them end in **-a**.


The following sentences are in SVO order.

**me niama aple.**
– I eat apples.  
**me vida te.**
– I see you.


### 7.4. Passive Sentences

In the passive voice the focus of the sentence is on a subject
that is a passive recipient that undergoes the action.
So the recipient is the subject of the sentence.
Often the agent is not mentioned at all.

In Pandunia, the passive voice is expressed with the verb ending in **-u**.
The word order is subject–verb–(optional object) or, more precisely,
recipient–verb–(optional agent).

**te vidu.**
– You are seen.  
**musike audu.**
– Music is heard.  
**pang beku.**
– Bread is baked.  
**kupe kaputu.**
– Cup breaks. (Cup gets broken.)

The agent can be mentioned after the verb with or without the preposition **da**.

**te vidu me.** - You are seen by me.  
**te vidu da me.** - You are seen by me.

Sometimes a passive verb can be translated with an active verb in English.
That is sometimes the case with **suku**, which means _to be pleased by_ (a passive verb) or _to like_ (an active verb).
That is because the direction of pleasing is from the active doer to the passive recipient.

**me suku musike.**
– I am pleased by music. / I like music.


### 7.6. Pivot structure

#### 7.6.1. Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  
subject – verb 1 – object 1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 functions has dual role.
It is at the same time the object for verb 1 and the subject for verb 2.

**me wana te niama sabze.**
– I want you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **me wana** has **te** as its object.
At the same time, **te** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **niama sabze**.
So **te** is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.

### 7.7. Serial verbs

There can be two, three or even more verbs in a series,
and all of them are about the same subject
 
1. **me gowa dom.**
   – I go home.  
2. **me abla gowa dom.**
   – I can go home.  
3. **me wana abla gowa dom.**
   – I want to be able to go home.
   (Word for word: _I want can go home_!)

### 7.8. Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity.
This is done especially in commands and requests.

#### 7.8.1. Short pivot structure (VOVO)

**me eska te baxa pandunia.**
– I ask do you speak Pandunia.  
**eska te baxa pandunia?**
– Do you speak Pandunia.

#### 7.8.2. Short pivot structure (VVO)

**me pliza te laya dom.**
– I ask you to come home.  
**pliza laya dom!**
– Please come home!
(Word for word: _Request come home!_)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Conjunctions

### 8.1. Basic conjunctions

1. **e** and (connects two similar words or phrases)
2. **o** or (connects two alternative words or phrases)
3. **a** - but (introduces a word or phrase that contrasts with or
   contradicts the preceding word or phrase)

**me suku maw e waf.**
– I like cats and dogs.  
**me suku maw o waf.**
– I like cats or dogs.  
**me suku maw a no waf.**
– I like cats but not dogs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Particles

### 9.1. Affirmation and Negation

### 9.1.1. Affirmative

Particle **si** is affirmative and **no** is negative.
**si** affirms the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it.
In other words **si** means "to be" or "there is" and **no** means "not to be" or "there is not".

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **si** is not always necessary.
However it is especially convenient in expressions of state.

**me si ren.**
– I am a person.  
**le si novi meze.**
– It is a new table.

### 9.1.2. Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

**me no ren.**
– I'm not a person.  
**le no novi meze.**
– It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything.
It affects always the next word.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location of the negative word.

**me vida te.**
– I see you.  
**me no vida te.**
– I don't see you.  
**me vida no te a lole.**
– I see, not you, but them.

**me pliza te safa kamar.**
– I ask you to clean the room.  
**me no pliza te safa kamar.**
– I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**me pliza te no safa kamar.**
– I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The particles **si** and **no** are used also for answering questions.

**eska te vida me?**
– Do you see me?  
**si. (me si vida te.)**
– Yes. (I do see you.)  
**no. (me no vida te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)

Negative questions are answered so that **si** and **no** apply to the verb, not the whole question.

**eska te no vida me?**
– Don't you see me?  
**si. (me si vida te.)**
– Yes. (I do see you.)  
**no. (me no vida te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)


### 9.2. Modifier particles

Particles **du** and **da** are used to link a noun, an adjective or a verb phrase to a noun to modify it.
**du** connects the modifying word or phrase to the main noun word.
**da** works in the opposite direction, it connects the main noun to the modifying word or phrase.

#### 9.2.1. Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **du** works like the apostrophe-s ('s) in English.
It indicates that the previous word has possession of the next one.

**maria du mame**
– Maria's mother  
**maria du mame du dom**
– Maria's mother's house

**da** works like "of" in English.
It indicates that the next word has possession of the previous one.

**mame da maria**
– the mother of Maria  
**dom da mame da maria**
– the house of the mother of Maria

It's possible to use **da** and **du** with personal pronouns too,
so one can say things like
**dom da me** (_the house of mine_)
but it's better to use the short possessive pronouns and say simply
**mi dom** (_my house_).

#### 9.2.2. Modification with adjectives

With **da** it's possible to move a modifier after the noun.

**novi idey**
– a new idea  
**idey da novi**
– an idea of new

#### 9.2.3. Modification with noun phrases

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun.
It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

**rozi rang du labe**
– rose-colored lips  
**samani rang du kan**
– sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

**labe da rozi rang**
– lips of the rose-color  
**kan da samani rang**
– eyes of the sky-color

The particles help in creating measure words too.
 
**un sake du patate**
– one sack of potatos  
**dul sake du patate**
– two sacks of potatos  
**max sake du patate**
– more sacks of potatos
 
Note that **du** and **da** connect phrases together.
So a modifier phrase with and without **du** can mean a different thing.

**max sundar pul**
– more beautiful flowers  
**max du sundar pul**
– more of beautiful flowers

#### 9.2.4. Modification with verb phrases

Verbs and verb phrases are turned into modifiers by placing **da** or **du** immediately next to the verb.
The places of the agent and the recipient stay the same in modifying phrases as in declarative phrases.

A declarative phrase:  
**maw vidu me.**
– A cat is seen by me.

The corresponding modifying phrase:  
**maw da vidu me**
– the cat that is _seen by me_

Note! Although **da** seems to have a similar role here as English relative pronouns _which_, _that_, _who_ and _whom_,
it's still nothing more than a particle connecting a modifier (in this case: a verb phrase) to the modified.

The opposite word order is made with **du** and the verb ending in **-a**.

A declarative phrase:  
**me vida maw.**
– I see a cat.

The corresponding modifying phrase:  
**me vida du maw**
– _My seen_ cat i.e. the cat _that I see_

Pay attention to the final vowels! They are crucial for the meaning!

**maw da vidu man**
– the cat that is seen by the man  
**maw da vida man**
– the cat that sees the man  
**maw vida du man**
– the _cat-seen_ man  
**maw vidu du man**
– the _cat-seeing_ man

Note! In Pandunia, words can be put in many different orders.
That's why some translations sound clumsy in English although the original phrases are perfectly natural in Pandunia.

#### 9.2.5. Modification with adposition phrases

The modified noun can be part of an adposition phrase too.

**me safara pa du site si teli.**
– My destination city is far away.

With the modified noun at the beginning, we need to call into action the otherwise rarely used postpositions
**nu**, **cu**, **su**, and **pu**.

**site da pu me safara si teli.**
– The city I’m traveling to is far away.  
**yi kalam da su me zay kitaba si novi.**
– This pen, with which I’m writing now, is new.


### 9.3. Modal Particles

Modal particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in relation to the listener.
Modal particles are commonly used in many languages.
East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a modal particle modifies the subsequent word, or the whole sentence,
when the modal particle is the last word in the sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions much like in English.

**le niama bir plus.**
– S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
**le niama plus bir.**
– S/he drinks _also beer_.  
**le plus niama bir.**
– S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
**plus le niama bir.**
– _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Modal particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.


### 9.4. Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed.
The general time words are **pas** (past), **zay** (present) and **wil** (future, upcoming).
They function like adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb.

**me pas tena maw.**
– I had cats.  
**a me no zay tena maw.**
– But I now don't have cats.  
**ablo me wil tena maw.**
– Maybe I will have cats.

It's also possible to say it in a longer way like **sa pase** (in the past) etc.

**me tena maw sa pase.**
– I had cats in the past.  
**a me no tena maw sa zaye.**
– But I don't have cats at present.  
**ablo me tena maw sa wile.**
– Maybe I will have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated.
So the verb **tena** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary.
Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text
and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.

## 10. Prepositions

### 10.1. Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has four prepositions of place and time.

1. **sa** - presence, location or moment (in general): with, at, in,
   on, by, during, while
2. **na** - absence or lack: without
3. **ca** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
4. **pa** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

**me sa hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
**me sona sa hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
**me sona ca xam pa sube.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
**me safara du london pa paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

**me denga ca te gowa.** - I have waited since you left.  
**me denga pa te laya dom.** - I wait until you come home.  
**me denga sa te sona.** - I wait while you sleep.  

#### 10.1.2. sa

**sa** is an all-purpose preposition. Its basic meaning is "with".
 
**me libu sa dom.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**me loga sa pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**me loga sa doste sa pandunia sa fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia by telephone.

#### 10.1.3. Verbs as prepositions

In Pandunia some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

**me kata pang.** - I cut bread.  
**me kata pang, uza caku.** - I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

**me denga dura dul hor.** - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

**bada** - to follow; after, behind  
**dura** - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
**jungu** - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
**loka** - to occupy, to be located; at  
**sirka** - to surround; around  
**supra** - to surpass; over, above  

#### 10.1.4. Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

**me laya dom.** - I come home.  
**te sida kurse.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
**le lala sofa'.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
**fix nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
**jenger marca daw.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

### 10.2. Preposition of relation

Preposition **ko** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to
English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

**me jana pandunia ko gur.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**ko** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In
the above example **jana** (know) is the verb and **gur** (master) is
the point of comparison.

**ko** is also used when adjectives are compared.

**bace si min day ko pape.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
**law pape si sam day ko pape.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**ko** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min**
(less) and **sam** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is
**pape** (father) in the examples above.



## 11. Word building

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia. Pandunia has a
productive system of word derivation. Most of the suffixes that are
used in Pandunia are already in international use. Many of hem come
from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.

### 11.1. Word class markers

Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation.
In this system the final vowel of a word indicates its word class.
So the stem of the word indicates a general idea
and the vowel endings indicate different manifestations of that idea:
a thing (noun), a description (modifier) and an action (verb).

Pandunia uses the following vowel endings to mark parts of speech.

- **-e** marks nouns that are derived from action roots and description roots
- **-i** indicates adjectives
- **-o** indicates adverbs
- **-a** indicates active verbs
- **-u** indicates passive verbs

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of word from another.
An ending is simply changed to another ending.

- The ending -e converts the idea into a thing.
  For example **nile** means blue color.
- The ending -i converts the idea into a description.
  The resulting modifier describes another idea with the modifying idea.
  For example **nili dom** means a blue house.
- The ending -a converts the idea into an action.
  The resulting verb is about applying the idea to an object.
  For example **nila dom** means _to apply blue on the house_ i.e. _to make the house blue_.
- The ending -u creates an action just like -a.
  The only difference is that the word order is reversed.

All endings can be applied on all ideas in the same way.

Here are a few examples of different types of ideas.

- concrete action
    - **kitabe** a writing (noun)
    - **kitabi** written, textual (modifier)
    - **kitaba** to write (active verb)
	- **kitabu** to be written (passive verb)
- abstract action
    - **fikre** a thought (noun)
    - **fikri** thinking (modifier)
    - **fikra** to think (active verb)
	- **fikru** to be thought (passive verb)
- description
    - **longe** length (noun)
    - **longi** long (modifier)
    - **longa** to make long, to lengthen (active verb)
	- **longu** to get long (passive verb)
- tool
    - **hamar** a hammer (noun)
    - **hamari** "hammery", hammerlike (modifier)
    - **hamara** to hammer, to apply hammer on sth (active verb)
	- **hamaru** to be hammered (passive verb)


#### 11.1.2. Deriving verbs

**-a** and **-u** are the endings for verbs.

1. If the stem's idea is an action, then its verb form will mean "to do the action".
   For example from **vide** (_a look_) we get **vida** (_to look_).
2. If the idea is a description then its verb form will mean "to turn into that quality".
   For example from **novi** (_new_) we get **nova** (_to make new_ or _to renew_).
3. If the idea is a thing, then its verb form will mean "to apply it to".
   For example from **hamar** (_hammer_) we get **hamara** (_to hammer_).


#### 11.1.3. Deriving nouns

**-e** is the ending for nouns.

If the stem's idea is an action, then its noun form will mean the result or the product of the action.
For example from **kitaba** (_to write_) we get **kitabe** (_writing_ or _text_).


If the idea is a description, then its noun form will mean a concrete instance of that quality.
For example from **novi** (_new_) we get **nove** (_a novelty_ i.e. something new).

Additional noun suffixes are presented below.

#### 11.1.4. Deriving adjectives

**-i** is the ending for adjectives and adjectival verbs.

If the stem's idea is a description, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is in the state of the root".
For example from **nov-** (_newness_), we get **novi** (_new_ i.e. _that which is new_).

If the idea is an action, then its adjectival form will mean the state that is produced by the action.
For example from **loga** (_to speak_) we get **logi** (_spoken_).

If the idea is a thing, an object or a person, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is like the root".
For example, from the noun **insan** (_human being_), we get the adjective **insani** (_human_, having the attributes of a human being).

If the root is a place word, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is from that place".

**irania** Iran, **irani** Iranian  
**pakistan** Pakistan, **pakistani** Pakistani  
**amerike** America, **ameriki** American  
**europe** Europe, **europi** European  
**asia** Asia, **asi** Asian

#### 11.1.5. Words without an ending

Some words in Pandunia don't have a vowel ending.
These are the rules:

- Verbs always have an ending: **-a** or **-u**.
- Modifiers almost always have the ending **-i**.
  The most common adjectives are exceptions to the rule: **bon, mal, lil, day**.
- Nouns have the ending after _hard_ consonants (ex. **supe, pede, yuke**)
  and consonant groups (ex. **cante, poste, zebre**)
  but not after _soft_ consonants (ex. **cay, maw, man, fem, hotel**).

For example we normally use short word **insan** (_human being_) instead of **insane**.
Likewise we normally say **bon** (_good_) instead of **boni**.
Note that it is always acceptable to use the vowel endings on every word.
It is an artistic choice by the authors of Pandunia to not require them on noun stems that end in soft vowels.


### 11.2. Compound words

Two or more words can be put together to make a _compound word_.
The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound
and the words that come before it only modify its meaning.

Compound words are made of bare word stems,
which are joined together by the linking vowel **-o-**.

For example, this is how **kanosuy** (_tears_) is made:

          kan       (eye)
       +  suy       (water)
    ____________
    = kanosuy       (eyewater, tear)

And this is how **termometer** (_thermometer_) is made:

         terme      (temperature)  
       + meter      (measuring device)
    ____________
    = termometer    (thermometer)

The linking vowel **-o-** is not used when the second word begins with a vowel.

          dew       (god)  
       + iste       (proponent, -ist)
    ____________
    =  dewiste      (theist)

The ending vowel of the first word is always dropped when a compound word is made.

         pace       (peace)
       + iste       (proponent, -ist)
    ____________
    =  paciste      (proponent of peace, pacifist)


### 11.3. Common Suffixes

#### 11.3.1. -bli

### 11.4. Function Words

_Function words_ are words that help to organize words into more or less complex sentences.
It is a closed class i.e. new words are never or only very seldom be added to it.
Function words behave by definition differently than _content words_,
which is the open class for words that refer to things in the world outside the structure of the language.

In Pandunia, function words have the following characteristics:

1. The word is made up of one consonant and one vowel.
2. The consonant indicates the general idea of the word.
3. The vowel has a structural meaning, as follows:
    - **-e** indicates a pronoun
    - **-i** indicates a determiner or a modifier
    - **-a** indicates a preposition
    - **-u** indicates a postposition

|  | Idea                   | -a (preposition)       | -e (noun or pronoun)   | -i (modifier)          | -u (postposition)      |
