# Grammar

## 0. Introduction

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in
Pandunia.  However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading
this grammar, for example with the help of a phrasebook and a
dictionary.

All language teachers know that a language becomes more difficult to
learn when the student must learn to make distinctions that he is not
used to making.  That's why students have difficulties with things
like irregular spelling, case-inflection, mandatory tenses, tones,
noun/adjective agreement, honorific inflection, consonant and vowel
harmony, mandatory gender distinctions and so on.

Pandunia is not a difficult language to learn. It doesn't have any of
the previously mentioned complexities. Instead, it has a simple
grammar, a relatively simple vocabulary, and a simple phonetic
spelling.

One thing to keep in mind as you learn Pandunia is that it is not a
strict, rule-oriented language where there is a "right way" and a
"wrong way" to say things. The important thing is to make yourself
understood. Consequently, much of the language involves the lexical
items (words that have meaning, like "book" or "eat"), and very little
involves purely grammatical ideas (like singular vs. plural and
tenses).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. The basic rules

These are the 11 basic rules of Pandunia language.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2. The stress is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of
   the word.
3. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
4. The adjectives and the adverb have the same form. They come before
   the word that they modify. Frequently adjectives end in **-i**.
    - ex. 1. **bon nan** = Good bread.
    - ex. 2. **tu bon loga.** = You speak well.
5. Compound words are formed by putting words side by side.
    - ex. **poste sanduke** = mailbox
6. Verbs that end in -a indicate subject-verb-object word order.
    - ex. **mi nyama nan.** = I eat bread.
7. Verbs that end in -u indicate object-verb-subject word order.
    - ex. **nan nyamu.** = The bread is eaten.
8. The verbs do not change for person or number.
9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb
   functions as the subject of the next verb.
    - ex. **mi cing tu dona mone.** = I ask you to give money.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **mi eska tu baxa pandunia?** → **eska tu baxa pandunia?** = Do
      you speak Pandunia?
    - **mi cing tu loga ming.** →  **cing loga ming.** = Please speak
      clearly.
11. Derived words carry an ending. Adjectives end in -i, nouns end in
    -e, and verbs end in -a or -u.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Nouns

### 2.1. Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing. Like all words in Pandunia, nouns
are invariant. So the same form is used in singular and plural, in
definite and indefinite, etc.

> **batú** - a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
> **meze** - a table, tables, the table or the tables  
> **kurse** - a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
> **suy** - water

Quite often number and definiteness is known because it was specified
earlier or because it is general knowledge. For example, normally the
word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **lun** refers to _the moon_, our
only sun and our only moon.

### 2.2. Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in
singular and plural.

An easy way to emphasize plurality is to repeat the noun.

> **batú batú** - stones, lots of stones  
> **xing xing** - stars, lots of stars  

### 2.3. Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine
and/or neuter categories).

Some words carry _natural gender_. For example **fem** (woman) is
feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.

### 2.4. Compounds

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word. The
last word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the words
that come before it only modify the meaning.

> **sol nur** - sunlight  
> **lun nur** - moonlight  
> **lun batú** - moonstone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to the
thing denoted by another word, ex. good, bad, big, fast.

### 3.1. Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun. In
Pandunia an adjective is a modifier that is before a noun.

> **day batú** - big stone
> **day meze** - big table  
> **gaw meze** - high table
> **bon kurse** - good chair

When adjective can be also after the noun. Often this type of phrases
can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

> **batú day.** - The stone is big.  
> **meze gaw.** - The table is high.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

> **day meze gaw.** - Big table is high.

### 3.2 Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia an adverb is a modifier that is before a verb or at the
end of the sentence.

> **mi _bon_ sona.** - I well sleep.  
> **mi sona _bon_.** - I sleep _well_.  
> **tu baxa pandunia _bon_.** - You speak Pandunia _well_.

### 3.4 Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier. For example **day** (big)
and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

> **day ren** - big person  
> **lil ren** - little person  
> **sundar ren** - beautiful person

> **day sundar ren** - very beautiful person  
> **lil sundar ren** - somewhat beautiful person

The modifiers can be separated by using **i** (and).

> **lil i sundar ren** - a little and beautiful person

### 3.5. Comparison

Modifiers can be compared.

- **max** (more) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim** (most) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min** (less) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim** (least) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **sem** (as) indicates the comparison of equality

Particle **ka** relates the adverbs of comparison to the point of
comparison.

> **mi si max bon ka tu.** - I am better than you.  
> **tu loga sem bon ka mi.** - You speak as well as mi.

#### 3.6. Modifier ending

Adjectives end in **-i** by default. The ending is used always with
words that are derived from action roots and thing roots. Ex. **logi**
_oral, spoken_, **suki** _happy_, **kitabi** _written, textual_.

The ending is not applied to description roots that end in a single
consonant that is easy to pronounce. Ex. **bon** _good_, **sundar**
_beautiful_.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Numerals

Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken
about. For example, the word **sol** (sun) normally refers to just one
sun because there is only one.

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words. They
are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

> **un xing** - one star  
> **do xing** - two stars  
> **sam xing** - three stars  
> **xaw xing** - few stara  
> **pol xing** - many stars

> **un day meze** - one big table  
> **do day kurse** - two big chairs  
> **sam bon kurse** - three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

> **fen un** - the first part (part one)
> **fen do** - the second part (part two)
> **fen sam** - the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nul**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **do**
- 3 **sam**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **set**
- 8 **bat**
- 9 **noy**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another –
exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of
mathematics.

- 10 **un nul** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un do**
- 13 **un sam**
- 20 **do nul**
- 21 **do un**
- 22 **do do**
- 100 **un nul nul** or **hon**
- 101 **un nul un** or **hon un**
- 200 **do nul nul** or **do hon**

Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the
International System of Units. So for example kilo denotes a multiple
of a thousand.

- 1000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    

## 5. Pronouns

### 5.1. Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute thing-words and phrases of thing-words.

**mi** - I, mi  
**tu** - you  
**ye** - he, she, it  
**mimen** - we  
**tumen** - you all  
**yemen** - they

**se** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons, so it
corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_,
_itself_, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi wida se** - I see myself.  **ye wida se** - She sees herself. /
He sees himself. / It sees itself.  **mimen wida se.** - We see
ourselves.  

### 5.2. Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns are:

**ce** - this one  
**de** - that one  

> **mi wola ce.** - I want this one.

They end in **-i** when they function as adjectives i.e. when they
come before a noun.

> **ci maw** - This cat  
> **di maw.** - That cat  

### 5.3. Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun. It does the job of
English words _who_ and _what_.

> **ke?** - Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ki** and it meanst the same
as English _which_.

> **ki xey?** - What? (Which thing?)  
> **ki ren?** - Who? (Which person?)  
> **ki zaman?** - When? (What time?)  
> **ki yang?** - How? (What manner?)  

Adjectives are questioned with **ki**.

> **ki day?** - How big?  
> **ki lil?** - How small?  
> **ki day da maw tu ada?** - How big cat do you have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Verbs

#### 6.1. General

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to
look and to think.

Pandunia has two types of verb: verbs that end in **-a** and verbs
that end in **-u**. The endings decide the order of the other
constituents (subject and object) in the sentence. So the sentence
structure depends on the type of the verb.

#### 6.2. Verbs that end in -a

Verbs that end in **-a** use this triangular pattern.

    Word order triangle for verbs that end in -a
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    S ← O

#### 6.2.1. SVO order

The most common word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object (SVO).
In this sentence structure the subject comes first, the verb second,
and the object third.

    subject-verb-object
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    S   O

Examples:  
**mi wida yemen.** - I see them.  
**tu beka nan.** - You bake bread.  

#### 6.2.2. OSV order

The second structure in this triangle is OSV. It is frequent in
dependant clauses.

    object-subject-verb
    
      V
     ↗ 
    S ← O

Examples:  
**ke tu wida?** - What do you see?  
**mi nyama nan, jo tu beka.** - I eat bread _that you baked._

#### 6.2.3. VOS order

The third structure of this triangle is VOS, which is rarely used.

    verb-object-subject
    
      V
       ↘
    S ← O

#### 6.3. Verbs that end in -u

Verbs that end in **-u** use this triangular pattern.

    Word order triangle for verbs that end in -u
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    O ← S

#### 6.3.1. SOV order

SOV order is commonly used alternative for SVO order.

    subject-object-verb
    
      V
     ↗ 
    O ← S

Examples:  
**mi yemen widu.** - _I them see._  
**tu nan beku.** - _You bread bake._

#### 6.3.2. OVS order

OVS order is common in "passive" sentences.

    object-verb-subject
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    O   S

Examples:  
**nan beku tu.** - Bread is baked by you.  
**tu suku mi.** - You are pleased by me.

#### 6.3.3. VSO order

VSO order is very rare but possible.

    verb-subject-object
    
      V
       ↘
    O ← S

### 6.3. Passive sentences

In passive sentence there is only object and verb but no subject (i.e.
agent).

> **mi widu.** - I am seen.  
> **nan beku.** - Bread is baked.  
> **kupe kaputu.** - Cup breaks. (Cup gets broken.)

### 6.4. Verb endings

Most verbs end in **-a** and **-u**. A handful of verbs are without a
standard ending.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Sentences

### 7.1. Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type. They may consist of only
one word, which draws the listener's attention to it.

> **maw!** - A cat!  
> **barxa!** - (It) rains!  

### 7.2. Stative Sentences

#### 7.2.1. With pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. In the
simplest sentences, the subject is a personal pronoun and the
predicate is an adjective or a noun.

> **mi bon.** - I am good.  
> **ye nowi.** - It is new.  
> **ye sara.** - She is Sara.  

The word **no** is added to form the negative.

> **mi no bon.** - I'm not good.  
> **ye no nowi.** - It's not new.  
> **ye no sara.** - She is not Sara.

Also two personal pronouns can be juxtaposed.

> **mi si ye.** - I am he/she.  
> **mi no tu.** - I'm not you.

#### 7.2.2. With noun subject

When the subject is a noun, the word **si** (yes) is added before the
predicate in positive sentences. The negative sentences use **no**
like above.

> **sara si bon.** - Sara is good.  
> **batú si day.** - The stone is big.  
> **meze si nowi.** - The table is new.  
> **meze no law.** - The table is not old.

#### 7.2.3. With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

> **jowan si sundar.** - Young is beautiful.  
> **nowi no law.** - New is not old.  

#### 7.2.4. To be

Pandunia doesn't use a verb like "to be" in English.

### 7.3. Active Sentences

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is a verb
(i.e. an action-word). In Pandunia, verbs are easy to identify because
most of them end in **-a** or **-u**.

Active sentences that use a verb ending in **-a** have the
subject–verb–object word order (SVO).

> **mi nyama aple.** - I eat apples.  
> **mi auda musike.** - I hear music.  
> **mi wida tu.** - I see you.

Verbs ending in **-u** are used in the subject–object–verb word order
(SOV).

**mi aple nyamu.** - _I apples eat._

SOV and SVO are the two most common word orders by far in the
languages of the world. SOV is used in languages like Hindi-Urdu,
Tamil, Turkish, Japanese and Korean. SVO is used in English, Spanish,
Mandarin Chinese, Indonesian and Modern Arabic among others.

### 7.4. Passive Sentences

#### 7.4.1. OV order

In the passive voice there is no agent subject in the sentence. There
is only the object and the verb. Normally the passive is expressed
with object–verb (VO) word order with the verb ending in **-u**.

> **tu widu.** - You are seen.  
> **musike audu.** - Music is heard.  
> **nan beku.** - Bread is baked.

Here the focus is on the object, which is the first word in the
sentence. The object is a passive actor that undergoes the action.

The agent can be mentioned after the verb with or without the
preposition **du**.

> **tu widu mi.** - You are seen by me.  
> **tu widu du mi.** - You are seen by me.

#### 7.4.2. OV order

In verb–object (VO) order the focus is on the verb.

> **wida tu.** - Seeing you.  
> **auda musike.** - Listening music.  
> **beka nan.** - Baking bread.

### 7.5. All Possible Word Orders

There are six possible word orders for the transitive sentence. In
practice, all of them are possible in Pandunia. They are made possible
by the two verb endings, which decide the order of the other
constituents (subject and object).

Different orders put the focus on different constituents: the subject,
the object or the verb. The focus or emphasis is on the first part of
a sentence.

    1. With the verb ending in -a
        - object–subject–verb (OSV) : musike mi auda.
        - subject–verb–object (SVO) :        mi auda musike.
        - verb–object–subject (VOS) :           auda musike mi.
    2. With the verb ending in -u
        - subject-object-verb (SOV) : mi musike audu.
        - object-verb-subject (OVS) :    musike audu mi.
        - verb-subject-object (VSO) :           audu mi musike.

The constituent, which is further away from the verb, can be left out.
So for example **musike mi auda** (OSV) can be truncated to **mi
auda** (SV). Likewise **mi musike audu** (SOV) can be truncated to
**musike audu** (OV).

The typical word orders in everyday Pandunia are SVO, SOV and OSV. The
other word orders can be heard in poetry and in other forms of
literary language.

### 7.6. Pivot structure

#### 7.6.1. Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  subject – verb 1 – object
1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 functions has dual role. It is at the same time the object
for verb 1 and the subject for verb 2.

> **mi wol tu nyama sabze.** - I want you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **mi wol** has **tu** as its object. At the same
time, **tu** functions as the subject of the following predicate,
**nyama sabze**. So **tu** is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.

### 7.7. Serial verbs

All action-words (verbs) that come one after another are activated by
the subject. There can be two, three or even more action-words in
series.
 
1. **mi enda dom.** - I go home.  
2. **mi ken enda dom.** - I can go home.  
3. **mi wol ken enda dom.** - I want to be able to go home. (Lit. _I
   want can go home_!)

### 7.8. Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity.
This is done especially in commands and requests.

#### 7.8.1. Short pivot structure (VOVO)

> **mi eska tu baxa pandunia.** - I ask do you speak Pandunia.  
> **eska tu baxa pandunia?** - Do you speak Pandunia.

#### 7.8.2. Short pivot structure (VVO)

> **mi cing tu laya dom.** - I ask you to come home.  
> **cing laya dom!** - Please come home! (Literally: _Request come home!_)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Conjunctions

### 8.1. Basic conjunctions

1. **i** and (connects two similar words or phrases)
2. **u** or (connects two alternative words or phrases)
3. **a** - but (introduces a word or phrase that contrasts with or
   contradicts the preceding word or phrase)

> **mi suku maw i waf.** - I like cats and dogs.  
> **mi suku maw u waf.** - I like cats or dogs.  
> **mi suku maw a no waf.** - I like cats but not dogs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Particles

### 9.1. Affirmation and Negation

### 9.1.1. Affirmative

Particle **si** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **si** affirms
the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it. In other words
**si** means "to be" or "there is" and **no** means "not to be" or
"there is not".

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **si** is not
always necessary. However it is especially convenient in expressions
of state.

> **mi si ren.** - I am a person.  
> **ye si nowi meze.** - It is a new table.

### 9.1.2. Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

> **mi no ren.** - I'm not a person.  
> **ye no nowi meze.** - It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.

> **mi wida tu.** - I see you.  
> **mi no wida tu.** - I don't see you.  
> **mi wida no tu a yemen.** - I see, not you, but them.

The particles **si** and **no** are used also for answering questions.

> **eska tu wida mi?** - Do you see me?  
> **si. (mi si wida tu.)** - Yes. (I do see you.)  
> **no. (mi no wida tu.)** - No. (I don't see you.)

Negative questions are answered so that **si** and **no** apply to the
verb, not the whole question.

> **eska tu no wida mi?** - Don't you see me?  
> **si. (mi si wida tu.)** - Yes. (I do see you.)  
> **no. (mi no wida tu.)** - No. (I don't see you.)

### 9.2. Modifier particles

Particles **da** and **du** are used to mark possession and
modification.  **da** connects the modifying word or phrase to the
modified word. **du** works in the opposite direction. It connects the
modified word to the modifier.

#### 9.2.1. Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **da** works like apostrophe-s ('s) in
English.

> **maria da mamá** - Maria's mother  
> **mi da dom** - my house  
> **mi da papá da dom** - my father's house

**du** works like "of" in English.

> **mamá du maria** - the mother of Maria  
> **dom du mi** - the house of mine  
> **dom du papá du mi** - the house of the father of mine

#### 9.2.2. Attribution with adjectives

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other
words with a noun. It gives us more information about the noun, and
the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that
consists of two or more words.

> **roze rang da labe** - rose-colored lips  
> **saman rang da yen** - sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

> **labe du roze rang** - lips of the color of the rose  
> **yen du saman rang** - eyes of the color of the sky

The particles help in creating measure words too.
 
**un sake da patate** - one sack of potatos  
**do sake da patate** - two sacks of potatos  
**max sake da patate** - more sacks of potatos
 
Note that **da** and **du** connect phrases together. So a modifier
phrase with and without **da** can mean a different thing.

**max sundar pul** - more beautiful flowers  
**max da sundar pul** - more of beautiful flowers

#### 9.2.3. Relative clauses

Also relative clauses are created with help of the modifier particles.

Here **du** has a similar role as English relative pronouns _which_,
_that_, _who_ and _whom_.

> **ye si man _du mi wida_.** - He is the man _that I saw_.

If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object
(i.e. if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied
subject of the relative clause.

> **mi wida man _du nyama aple_.** - I see a man _who eats apples_.  

It's possible to construct relative clauses with **da** too. Then the
relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. The verb is turned
into a modifier by putting **da** immediately after the verb.

> **mi wida _aple nyamu da_ man.** - I see an _apple-eating_ man.

> **buke dugu da ren na kamar.** = The book-reading person is in the room.  
> **ye duga da buke na meze.** = The book, that he/she reads, is on the table.

### 9.3. Modal Particles

Modal particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in
relation to the listener. Modal particles are commonly used in many
languages. East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use
famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a modal particle modifies the subsequent word, or the
whole sentence, when the modal particle is the last word in the
sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions
much like in English.

> **ye nyama bir plus.** - S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
> **ye nyama plus bir.** - S/he drinks _also beer_.  
> **ye plus nyama bir.** - S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
> **plus ye nyama bir.** - _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Modal particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.

### 9.4. Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases
if needed. The general time words are **pas** (past), **zay**
(present) and **wil** (future, upcoming). They function like
adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb.

> **mi pas ada maw.** - I had cats.
> **a mi no zay ada maw.** - But I now don't have cats.
> **munkin mi wil ada maw.** - Maybe I will have cats.

It's also possible to say it in a longer way like **na pase** (in the
past) etc.

> **mi ada maw na pase.** - I had cats in the past.  
> **a mi no ada maw na zaye.** - But I don't have cats at present.  
> **munkin mi ada maw na wile.** - Maybe I will have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated. So the verb **ada** stayed the same in
all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary. Usually it
is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text
and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Prepositions

### 10.1. Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has four prepositions of place and time.

1. **na** - presence, location or moment (in general): with, at, in,
   on, by, during, while
2. **be** - absence or lack: without
3. **ze** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
4. **to** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

> **mi na hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
> **mi sona na hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
> **mi sona ze xam to suba.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
> **mi safara ze london to paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

> **mi denga ze tu enda.** - I have waited since you left.  
> **mi denga to tu lay dom.** - I wait until you come home.  
> **mi denga na tu sona.** - I wait while you sleep.  

#### 10.1.2. na

**na** is an all-purpose preposition. Its basic meaning is "with".
 
**mi stasa na dom.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**mi loga na pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**mi loga na doste na pandunia na fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia in telephone.

#### 10.1.3. Verbs as prepositions

In Pandunia some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

> **mi kata nan.** - I cut bread.  
> **mi kata nan, uza caku.** - I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

> **mi denga dura do hor.** - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

> **bada** - to follow; after, behind  
> **dura** - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
> **jungu** - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
> **loka** - to occupy, to be located; at  
> **sirka** - to surround; around  
> **supra** - to surpass; over, above  

#### 10.1.4. Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

> **mi laya dom.** - I come home.  
> **tu sida kurse.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
> **ye lala sofá.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
> **fix nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
> **janger marca daw.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

### 10.2. Preposition of relation

Preposition **ka** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to
English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

> **mi saba pandunia ka gurú.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**ka** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In
the above example **saba** (know) is the verb and **gurú** (master) is
the point of comparison.

**ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

> **bace si min day ka papá.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
> **opá si sem day ka papá.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**ka** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min**
(less) and **sem** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is
**papá** (father) in the examples above.

## 11. Word Building

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia. Pandunia has a
productive system of word derivation. Most of the suffixes that are
used in Pandunia are already in international use. Many of hem come
from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.

### 11.1. Part of speech markers

Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation. In this system
the final vowel of a word marks the type of the word. The system
applies mainly to those words, which are derived from action-roots and
description-roots. Some adjectives are also derived from thing-roots.
Pronouns, conjuctions, numerals and particles are outside of the word
derivation system.

Pandunia uses the following vowel endings to mark parts of speech.

- **a** marks verbs for subject-verb-object word order (SVO)
- **u** marks verbs for object-verb-subject word order (OVS)
- **i** marks adjectives i.e. modifiers of nouns
- **e** marks nouns that are derived from action roots and description roots

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of
word from another. An ending is simply changed to another ending. Here
are some examples.

**loga** - to speak (active verb)  
**logu** - to be spoken (passive verb)  
**logi** - spoken, wordy (adjective)  
**loge** or **log** - speech, word(s) (noun)  

**kitaba** - to write (active verb)  
**kitabu** - to be written (passive verb)  
**kitabi** - written, textual (adjective)  
**kitabe** or **kitab** - writing, text (noun)  

**nowi** or **now** - new (adjective)  
**nowa** - to make new (active verb)  
**nowu** - to become new (passive verb)  
**nowe** - novelty, new thing (noun)  

There is a handful of verbs, which appear without the ending. These
are some of the most common verbs in Pandunia.

**wol** - to want (active verb)  
**ken** - can, to be able to (active verb)  

#### 11.1.2. Deriving verbs

Dynamic verbs end in **-a** and **-u**. From the narrow perspective of
a phrase that consists of only a subject and a verb, it can be said
that **-a** marks an active verb and **-u** marks a passive verb. So
**loga** means _to speak_ and **logu** means _to be spoken_.

1. If the root is an action, then its verbal form will mean "to do the
   action".  For example from **wide** = "a look" we get **wida** =
   "to look".
2. If the root is a description, like **now-** (**nowi** = new), then
   its verbal form will mean "to turn into that quality". For example
   from **nowi** = "new" we get **nowa** = "to make new" or "to
   renew".

#### 11.1.3. Deriving nouns

**-e** is the marker of nouns. It means the result of the process. So
**loge** means the _speech_ that results from the act of speaking.
Quite often **-e** is left out and so **log** would mean the same
thing as **loge**.

If the root word is an action, then its noun form will mean the
product of the action. For example from **kitab-** = "to write" we get
**kitabe** = "writing" or "text".

If the root word is a description, then its noun form will mean a
concrete instance of that quality. For example from **now-** = "new"
we get **nowe** = "a novelty" i.e. something new.

Additional noun suffixes are presented below.

#### 11.1.4. Deriving modifiers

**-i** is the marker of adjective and adjectival verb (i.e. static
verb). It is the all-purpose adjective suffix.

For example, from the verb **loga** (to speak) we get the adjective
**logi** (spoken, wordy). From the noun **manux** (human being), we
get the adjective **manuxi** (human, having the attributes of a human
being). However, only derived adjectives need to end in **-i**.

Words that are adjectives _by birth_ don't need the ending. That's why
for example **bon** (good) and **sundar** (beautiful) don't end in -i.

If the root word is a description, then its adjectival form will mean
"that which is in the state of the root". For example from **now-** =
quality of novelty, we get **nowi** = _new_ i.e. _that which is new_.

If the root is an action, then its adjectival form will mean the state
that is produced by the action. For example from **loga** = "to speak"
we get **logi** = "spoken".

If the root is a thing, an object or a person, then its adjectival
form will mean "that which is like the root".

If the root is a place word, then its adjectival form will mean "that
which is from that place".

**iran** Iran, **irani** Iranian  
**pakistan** Pakistan, **pakistani** Pakistani  
**amerike** America, **ameriki** American  
**europe** Europe, **europi** European  
**asia** Asia, **asi** Asian

#### 11.1.5. Words without an ending

1. When a thing-root serves as a noun, it doesn't need the noun
   ending.
2. When a description-root serves as an adjective, it doesn't need the
   adjective ending.
3. When an action-root serves as a verb, it doesn't always need the
   verb ending. (*)

|                  | Noun        | Adjective   | Verb        |
|:-----------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|
| Thing-root       | **insan**   | insani      | -           |
| Description-root | bone        | **bon**     | bona        |
| Action-root      | wole        | woli        | **wol**     |

Note! Pandunia doesn't follow the rule about action-roots because we
think that normally it is more useful to mark verbs than nouns. So an
action-root like **kitab** (writing) gives two verbs, **kitaba** and
**kitabu** – but the plain root, **kitab**, is used as a noun!

### 11.2. Derivational Suffixes

#### 11.2.1. -bli

Indicates possibility. It is attached after the verb root.

**widabli** which can be seen, visible  
**widubli** who/which can see

#### 11.2.2. -er

Creates agent nouns. It denotes a person or a tool who does the
action.

**loga** to speak; **loger** speaker, the one who speaks  
**beka** to bake; **beker** baker, the one who bakes  
**lida** to lead; **lider** leader, the one who leads  
**filsofa** to think deeply; **filsofer** philosopher  
**komputa** to compute, to process data; **komputer** computer  
**morta** to kill; **morter** killer  

The derivative can be also more loosely associated with the root.

**sapate** shoe; **sapater** shoemaker  
**muskete** musket; **musketer** musketeer  
**kase** cash desk; **kaser** cashier  

<!--

#### 11.2.2. -ur

Creates patient nouns from action roots. It denotes a person or a
thing to whom the action is done.

**kriata** to create; **kriatur** creature, the one who is created  
**morta** to kill; **mortur** the one who gets killed; by extension: a martyr  
**folda** to fold; **foldur** folder, something that is folded

#### 11.2.3. -ia

Creates aggregate nouns. It denotes a group of elements named by the
root as a whole.

**insan** human being; **insania** humanity, mankind, all the human beings as a group.  
**kristi** Christian, **kristia** Christianity, all Christians as a group.  
**filsof** view, outlook, life wisdom; **filsofia** philosophy, the discipline of wisdom.  

This ending is often found in place names, especially in country
names. However this use is not systematic and it's not required. There
are also a lot of country names that do not end in **-ia**.

**arabi** Arab, Arabic; **arabia** Arabia  
**rusi** Russian; **rusia** Russia  
**turki** Turk, Turkish; **turkia** Turkey

## 12. Advanced Topics

Note: You can learn the language without reading this chapter. But if
you're interested in the inner workings of the language, it can be
interesting to you.

### 12.1. Sentence Word Orders

In theory, there are six possible word orders for the transitive
sentence. In practice, all of them are possible in Pandunia. They are
made possible by the two verb endings, which decide the order of the
other constituents (subject and object).

    1. With the verb ending in -a
        - object–subject–verb (OSV) : musike mi auda.
        - subject–verb–object (SVO) :        mi auda musike.
        - verb–object–subject (VOS) :           auda musike mi.
    2. With the verb ending in -u
        - subject-object-verb (SOV) : mi musike audu.
        - object-verb-subject (OVS) :    musike audu mi.
        - verb-subject-object (VSO) :           audu mi musike.

The constituent, which is further away from the verb, can be left out.
So for example **musike mi auda** (OSV) can be truncated to **mi
auda** (SV). Likewise **mi musike audu** (SOV) can be truncated to
**musike audu** (OV).

The typical word orders in everyday Pandunia are SVO, SOV and OSV. The
latter occurs frequently in dependant clauses, for example in **mi
wida jen, jo tu suku.** (I saw the person _whom you like_.) The other
word orders can be heard in poetry and in other forms of literary
language.

### 12.2. Relations between the endings

A root is an idea that has many faces: a thing, a state, an action and
a transition.

- E-word names a thing whose defining characteristic (in the given
  context) is the root.
- I-word describes another word by the root. The thing named by the
  other word is in the state of the root.
- A-word is an action that produces a thing that is characterized by
  the root.  In other words, A-word produces the E-word.
- U-word is a transition that leads to the state of the root.

It makes always sense to apply the following formulas for a root that
is an action.

1. Description: -i -e
    - **kitabi kitabe.** - Written writing.
    - **dansi danse.** - Danced dance.
    - **soni sone.** - Sleepy sleep.
    - **rangi range.** - Colorful color.
2. Production: -a -e
    - **kitaba kitabe.** - To write a writing.
    - **dansa danse.** - To dance a dance.
    - **sona sone.** - To sleep a sleep.
    - **ranga range.** - To color a color.
3. Transition: -e -u
    - **kitabe kitabu.** - Writing gets written.
    - **danse dansu.** - Dance gets danced.
    - **sone sonu.** - Sleep gets slept.
    - **range rangu** - Color gets colored.

They are not very interesting things to be said, but they are true.
Normally production and transition formulas are applied to other roots
that belong to the same category as the original word. For example, we
write different kinds of writings, including letters, books and
novels, and we dance different kinds of dances, including tango, samba
and polka.

The same formulas can be applied to roots that describe a state.

1. Description: -i -e
    - **nowi nowe.** - New news.
    - **longi longe** - Long length.
2. Production: -a -e
    - **nowa nowe.** - To renew the new.
    - **longa longe.** - To lengthen the length.
3. Transition: -e -u
    - **nowe nowu.** - The new get renewed.
    - **longe longu.** - The length gets lengthened.

Description formula still gives meaningful (though obvious) phrases.
Production and transition formulas work better for gradual
descriptions (like "length") than for binary descriptions (like
"new"). When something is already new, it can't be made new. But when
something is already long, it can be made even longer.

### 12.3. Hierarchy of Word Types

Spoken language is a flow of sounds which constitute words. Written
language, in the case of Pandunia, is a flow of letters from left to
right, which constitute words. So every expression is essentially a
sequence of words.  However all words are not equal. There is a
hierarchy of words. The verb is the structural center of a sentence
and other words are directly or indirectly connected to it.

Each sentence can be drawn as a tree diagram, where the central words
are above and the dependant words are below. For example the sentence
**mi wida tu** (I see you) can be pictured as a tree as follows.

    mi wida tu.

       wida
      ┌─┴─┐
     mi   tu

Adjectives and numerals point to their head word, the noun.

    mi wida sam jowan ren.

       wida
      ┌─┴──┐
     mi   ren
           |
         jowan
           |
          sam

The hierarchy of word types in Pandunia from the more to the less
central is as follows.

1. Conjunctions: i, u, a
2. Connectors: da, du
3. Prepositions: na, ko, ze
4. Verbs
5. Nouns and pronouns
6. Tense, aspect and mood particles
7. Numerals
8. Adjectives

The following example shows how the scope affects the final position
of words in the tree hierarchy. For example, although **i** is in
general higher than **karena**, here its scope is only to connect
**yusef** and **sara**.  **karena** is at the top, because it connects
the two sub-phrases.

    yusef i sara wol darsa pandunia sababu ye si bon dunia bax.

                       sababu
               ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              wol                   si
          ┌────┴──────┐           ┌──┴──┐
          i         darsa        ye    bax
      ┌───┴───┐    ┌──┴────┐            |
    yusef   sara       pandunia       dunia
                                        |
                                       bon
