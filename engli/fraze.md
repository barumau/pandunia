# Basic words and phrases

## Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for
everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

English speakers will find it easy to make basic sentences in Pandunia as the
word order is generally the same as in English, there are no definite or
indefinite articles, no verb "to be", and no complicated rules about changing
the form of words to express singular and plural or the tense of verbs.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word,
which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you
how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other
new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to
learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you!
Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the
phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone.
Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the
same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on.
As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to
clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over
them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the
language. You can just speak Pandunia!

## Part 1: Greeting and basics

**salam niame!**
Bon appetit!

**salam lay!**
Welcome!

**salam cute!**
Goodbye!

**salam safare!**
Have a safe journey!

**salam sone!**
Sleep well!

As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for
well-wishing. Use it any time!

**Salam** is a popular greeting that is used by both religious and
non-religious people in many different countries around the world.

<small>Etymology. **salam** is from Arabic: سَلَام‏ "salām", Hebrew:
שָׁלוֹם‏ "šalom", Turkish: selam, Hindi: सलाम "salām", Swahili: salaam,
Indonesian: selamat.</small>

Thanks a lot!

**no, danke.**
No, thank you.

**danka te.**
Thank you.

**me danka te.**

**me danka te helpa me.**
I thank you for helping me.

**danka te helpa me.**

### me <small>I, me</small>

<p style="font-size:5em;">🗨️🧑</p>

**me sarah.**
I'm Sarah.

**me tomas.**
I'm Thomas.

You can introduce yourself simply by saying **me** and your name. You don't
need a verb for saying it in Pandunia!

**me salama mame.**
I greet mother.

**me salama pape.**
I greet father.

The word **salam** is a noun and **salama** is the corresponding verb. The
basic word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object.

**sarah salama tomas.**
Sarah greets Thomas.

**salam mame!**
Greetings, mother!

**salam pape!**
Greetings, father!

<small>Etymology. **me**
is from English: me, Hindi: मैं (meṇ), Spanish: me.</small>


### te <small>you</small>

<p style="font-size:4em;">🗣️👉👤</p>

**te tomas.**
You are Thomas.

**me salama te.**
I greet you.

**te salama me.**
You greet me.

Pronouns don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **me** is the
same in subject and object positions while English has two different forms, 'I'
and 'me'.

**me ama te.**
I love you.

<small>Etymology. **te** is from Hungarian: te, Russian: ты (ty), Italian: te, French: te.</small>

<p style="font-size:4em;">👥🗣️👉👤</p>

**le man.**

**le** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective
of gender) as well as for things.

**me salama le.**
I greet him/her.

<small>Etymology. **le** is from French: elle, Spanish: él.</small>


### eska <small>to ask a question</small>

<p style="font-size:5em">🤔❓</p>

**eska te tomas?**
Are you Thomas?

**eska te dotore?**
Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **eska**. It is just a regular
verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply
abbreviated from **me eska te dotore.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the
first word.

**eska te bon?**
How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)  
**me bon.**
I'm good.  
**eska te?**
And you?  
**me no bon.**
I'm not good.

<small>Etymology. **eska**
is from French: est-ce que /ɛskə/, Haitian Creole: èske, English: ask.</small>

used in place of "to be".

**aple si pale.**
The apple is a fruit.

<small>Etymology. **si** is from Spanish: sí, Portuguese: sim, Mandarin: 是

Are you well?  
**si. me bon.**
Yes, I'm well.

**eska te bon?**

**no. me no bon.**
No, I'm not well.

You can use **no** to deny anything. It is placed before the word that is
denied.

**le no salama me.**
He/she doesn't greet me.

<small>Etymology. **no**
is from Spanish: no, English no, French: non.</small>


### Plurals

Plural pronouns are created like this:
**me** (I) →  **mome** (we)  
**te** (you) →  **tote** (you all)

**ye kirmi aple.**
