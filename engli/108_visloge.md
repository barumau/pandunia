# Pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

## Personal pronouns

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **me**      | **mome**     |
| I, me       | we           |
| **te**      | **tote**     |
| you         | you all      |
| **le**      | **lole**     |
| he or she   | they         |

All pronouns can be used for all genders.
The most common third person pronoun is **le**
but also **ye** (_this_) and **ve** (_that_) can be used instead.

The possessive pronouns are:

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi**      | **momi**     |
| my          | our          |
| **ti**      | **toti**     |
| your        | your         |
| **li**      | **loli**     |
| his or her  | their        |


## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**se**
– self

Note! The same reflexive pronoun is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**me vida se**
– I see myself.  
**le vida se**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mome vida se.**
– We see ourselves.

## Reciprocal pronoun

The word **unale** is used as the reciprocal pronoun.

**unale**
– each other, one another

**me e te vida unale.**
– Me and you see each other.  
**mome vida unale.**
– We see each other.


## Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns are:

**ye** / **yi**
– this  
**ve** / **vi**
– that  
**le** / **li**
– it, the aforementioned

The form that ends in **-e** is used when the demonstrative stands alone,
and the form that ends in **-i** is used when the demonstrative modifies a noun.

The proximal demonstrative **ye** points to things that are near the speaker.
The distal demonstrative **ve** points to things that are far from the speaker.

**ye sa boni.**
– This is good.  
**ve sa dusi.**
– That is bad.  
**me vola yi buke, no vi.**
– I want this book, not that.

The basic proximal and distal pronouns are used for introducing a new object.
The topical demonstrative **le**, on the other hand,
does not specify physical distance
but it is used when the speaker has already mentioned the object or person in question
and it is known by the audience or is topical within the discourse.

**ye sa mau. le vola yama vi mux.**
– This is a cat. It wants to eat that mouse.

**me mala un mau e un vaf. li vaf sa dayi. le yama polo yam.**
– I own a cat and a dog. The dog is big. It eats a lot of food.


### Abstract use

The demonstrative pronouns can be used also discourse internally.
Then they refer to abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects.
**le** refers to things previously spoken,
**ye** refers to things currently being spoken,
and **ve** refers to things about to be spoken.

**yi jumle sa korti.**
– This sentence is short.

In the above, **yi jumle** (_this sentence_) refers to the sentence being spoken.

**me mena ve: me ama te.**
– I mean this: I love you. OR I mean that I love you.  
**me ama te. le me mena.**
– I love you. That is what I mean.

In the above, the pronoun **ve** refers to the content of the next statement
and **de** refers to the content of the previous statement.


## Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ki**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ki xei?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ki jan?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ki zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  

The adverbial interrogative pronoun is **ko**
and it means the same as English _how_.

Also adjectives are questioned with **ko**.

**ko novi?**
– How new?  
**ko kosti?**
– How costy?  
**ko poli?**
– How many?  
**ko dayi?**
– How big?  
**ko lili?**
– How small?

**te tena ko dayi mau?**
– How big cat do you have?


## Table of pronouns and other function words

_Function words_ are words that help to structure other words into more or less complex sentences.
It is a _closed class_ of words, so new words can never be added to it.
_Content words_, on the other hand, is an open, ever-growing class of words,
and they refer to things in the world outside the structure of the language.
Function words have only a structural role
and therefore they behave differently than content words.

In Pandunia, the pronouns and other function words that are derived from them have the following characteristics:

1. The word is made up of one consonant and one vowel.
2. The consonant indicates the general idea of the word.
   Sometimes the same consonant is used for expressing two different ideas.
3. The vowel has a structural meaning, as follows:
    - **-e** indicates a pronoun
    - **-i** indicates a determiner,
      which indicates definiteness, possession, etc.
    - **-o** indicates an adverb of manner
    - **-a** indicates a preposition
    - **-u** indicates a postposition
