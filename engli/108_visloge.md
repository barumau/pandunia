# Pronouns

## Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

**me**
– I, me  
**te**
– you  
**le**
– he, she, it  
**mome**
– we  
**tote**
– you all  
**lole**
– they

## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**se**
– self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**me vida se**
– I see myself.  
**le vida se**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mome vida se.**
– We see ourselves.

## Demonstrative pronoun

The demonstrative pronoun is:

**de**
– the one, this one, that one

**me vola de.**
– I want that.  
**le vola de.**
– He/she wants that.

It ends in **-i** when it functions as a modifier i.e. when it comes before a noun.

**di mau**
– the/this/that cat  
**di vaf**
– the/this/that dog  


## Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ki**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ki xei?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ki jan?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ki zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  

The adverbial interrogative pronoun is **ko**
and it means the same as English _how_.

Also adjectives are questioned with **ko**.

**ko novi?**
– How new?  
**ko kosti?**
– How costy?  
**ko poli?**
– How many?  
**ko dayi?**
– How big?  
**ko lili?**
– How small?

**te tena ko dayi mau?**
– How big cat do you have?
