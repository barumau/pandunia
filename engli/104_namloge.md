## Nouns

### Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing.
Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant.
So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

**seke**
– a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
**meze**
– a table, tables, the table or the tables  
**kurse**
– a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
**sui**
– water

Number and definiteness are often known because they were specified earlier in the discussion or because they are general knowledge.
For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **lun** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and moon.

### Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in singular and plural.
Number can be mentioned with number words when it is needed.

**kurse**
– a chair or chairs  
**un kurse**
– one chair  
**duli kurse**
– two chairs  
**sani kurse**
– three chairs  
**poli kurse**
– many chairs; chairs


### Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine and/or neuter categories).

Some words have _natural gender_.
For example **fem** (woman) is feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.
