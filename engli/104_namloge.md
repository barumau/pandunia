## Nouns

### Only one form

A noun is a word that names a thing.
Like all words in Pandunia, nouns don't ever change their form.
So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

**seke**
– a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
**meza**
– a table, tables, the table or the tables  
**kursi**
– a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
**sui**
– water

Number and definiteness are often known because they were previously mentioned in the conversation or because they are general knowledge.
For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **lun** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and moon.


### Indicating number

Pandunia nouns have the same form
in singular (when there is one)
and plural (when there is more than one).
Therefore all Pandunia nouns are like English words
_sheep_, _deer_ and _fish_,
which also have only one form.

A numeral or another quantity word can be added to indicate number
– but usually it's not necessary.
Simply insert a numeral in front of the unchanged noun.

**meme**
– (one or more) sheep  
**un meme**
– a sheep or one sheep  
**du meme**
– two sheep  
**tri meme**
– three sheep

**kursi**
– a chair or chairs  
**un kursi**
– one chair  
**du kursi**
– two chairs  
**tri kursi**
– three chairs

An easy way to say that there are many is to repeat the noun two times.

**seke seke**
– stones and stones, a variety of stones  
**buke buke**
– books and books, a variety of books


### Proper names

Proper names are nouns for individual people, places and other things.

Names of people can be tagged with titles of respect
**si**, **ma**, **pa**.
They are meant to show respect and politeness.

**si**
is the universal title of respect.
It can be used in formal and informal situations and for all age groups, social groups and genders.
The closest translation for it in English is _Mr or Ms_ or _Mx_.

**ma**
can be used when addressing any woman
regardless of age, social status, and marital status.
It translates to several titles in English including _Mrs_, _Miss_, _Ms_, _Madam_ and _Ma'am_.

**pa**
can be used when addressing any man
regardless of age, social status, and marital status.
It translates to several titles in English including _Mister_ and _Sir_.

There are different customs concerning honorific titles in different cultures.
In some cultures it is not polite to use someone's name without a title of respect.
Therefore it is advisable to use them always when you meet new people from different cultures.

A title of respect can be used with a given name, a family name, or both.

**si Bili King**
– Mx Billy King  
**si Bili**
– Mx Billy  
**si King**
– Mx King

It is always polite to use the gender-neutral title.
However, some people are more accustomed to using separate titles for men and women.

**pa Felipe Gonzales**
– Mr Felipe Gonzales  
**pa Felipe**
– Mr Felipe  
**pa Gonzales**
– Mr Gonzales

The order of the given name and the family name may be different in different cultures.
For example in Chinese it is common to put the family name first.

**ma Wang Lili**
– Ms Lili Wang  
**ma Lili**
– Ms Lili  
**ma Wang**
– Ms Wang


### Compound words

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word.
The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound,
and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

**sol fote**
– sun light  
**lun fote**
– moon light  
**lun seke**
– moon stone
