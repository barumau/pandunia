# Word building

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia.
Pandunia has a productive system of word derivation.
Most of the suffixes that are used in Pandunia are already in international use.
Many of them come from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.

## Word class markers

Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation.
In this system the final vowel of a word indicates its word class.
So the root (i.e. stem) of the word indicates a general idea
and the vowel endings indicate different manifestations of that idea.

Pandunia uses the following vowel endings to mark parts of speech.

- **-e** indicates a noun (a thing)
- **-i** indicates an adjective (a description)
- **-o** indicates an adverb (a manner or a circumstance)
- **-a** indicates an active verb (an action)
- **-u** indicates a passive verb (an event)

They are the only true suffixes i.e. bound morphemes in Pandunia.
All other suffixes can be used also as independent words.
For example **paciste** (pacifist) is made up of two full words:
**pace** (peace) and **iste** (proponent).

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of word from another.
An ending is simply changed to another ending.

- The ending -e converts the idea into a thing.
  For example **nile** means the color blue.
- The ending -i converts the idea into a description.
  The resulting modifier describes another idea with the modifying idea.
  For example **nili dome** means a blue house.
- The ending -a converts the idea into an action.
  The resulting verb is about applying the idea to an object.
  For example **nila dome** means "to make the house blue".
- The ending -u creates an action just like -a.
  The only difference is that the word order is reversed so that the object comes first.
  For example **dome nilu** means "the house becomes blue".

All endings can be applied on all ideas in the same way.

Here are a few examples of different types of ideas.

- concrete action
    - **kitabe** a writing (noun)
    - **kitabi** written, textual (adjective)
    - **kitabo** by writing
    - **kitaba** to write (active verb)
    - **kitabu** to be written (passive verb)
- abstract action
    - **fikre** a thought (noun)
    - **fikri** thinking (adjective)
    - **fikro** by thinking (adverb)
    - **fikra** to think (active verb)
    - **fikru** to be thought (passive verb)
- description
    - **longe** length (noun)
    - **longi** long, lengthy (adjective)
    - **longo** lengthily (adverb)
    - **longa** to make long, to lengthen (active verb)
    - **longu** to get long, to be lengthened (passive verb)
- tool
    - **hamar** a hammer (noun)
    - **hamari** "hammery", hammerlike (adjective)
    - **hamaro** by/with/like a hammer
    - **hamara** to hammer, to apply hammer on sth (active verb)
    - **hamaru** to be hammered (passive verb)


### Deriving verbs

**-a** and **-u** are the endings for verbs.

1. If the stem's idea is an action, then its verb form will mean "to do the action".
   For example from **vide** (_a look_) we get **vida** (_to look_).
2. If the idea is a description then its verb form will mean "to turn into that quality".
   For example from **novi** (_new_) we get **nova** (_to make new_ or _to renew_).
3. If the idea is a thing, then its verb form will mean "to apply it to".
   For example from **hamare** (_hammer_) we get **hamara** (_to hammer_).


### Deriving nouns

**-e** is the ending for nouns.

If the stem's idea is an action, then its noun form will mean the result or the product of the action.
For example from **kitaba** (_to write_) we get **kitabe** (_writing_ or _text_).


If the idea is a description, then its noun form will mean a concrete instance of that quality.
For example from **novi** (_new_) we get **nove** (_a novelty_ i.e. something new).

Additional noun suffixes are presented below.

### Deriving adjectives

**-i** is the ending for adjectives and adjectival verbs.

If the stem's idea is a description, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is in the state of the root".
For example from **nov-** (_newness_), we get **novi** (_new_ i.e. _that which is new_).

If the idea is an action, then its adjectival form will mean the state that is produced by the action.
For example from **loga** (_to speak_) we get **logi** (_spoken_).

If the idea is a thing, an object or a person, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is like the root".
For example, from the noun **insan** (_human being_), we get the adjective **insani** (_human_, having the attributes of a human being).

If the root is a place word, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is from that place".

**irania** Iran, **irani** Iranian  
**pakistan** Pakistan, **pakistani** Pakistani  
**amerike** America, **ameriki** American  
**europe** Europe, **europi** European  
**asia** Asia, **asi** Asian

### Words without an ending

Some words in Pandunia don't have a vowel ending.
These are the rules:

- Verbs always have an ending: **-a** or **-u**.
- Modifiers almost always have the ending **-i**.
  The most common adjectives are exceptions to the rule: **bon, mal, lil, day**.
- Nouns almost always have the ending **-e** or **-ia**.
  Some common nouns and suffixes are exceptions to the rule (ex. **cay, maw, hotel, kitaber, helium**).

For example we normally use short word **insan** (_human being_) instead of **insane**.
Likewise we normally say **bon** (_good_) instead of **boni**.
Note that it is always acceptable to use the vowel endings on every word.
It is an artistic choice by the authors of Pandunia to not require them on these words.


## Compound words

Two or more roots can be put together to make a _compound word_.
The last root is the most meaningful part in the compound
and the roots that come before it only modify its meaning.

Compound words are made of bare word stems and a vowel ending.

For example, this is how the word **kansuye** (_tears_) is made:

          kan       (eye)
       +  suy       (water)
       +    e       (noun ending)
    ____________
    = kansuye       (eyewater, tear)

And this is how the word **andewisti** (atheistic) is made:

           an       (negation)
       +  dev       (god)
       +  ist       (proponent, -ist)
       +    i       (adjective ending)
   _____________
   = andevisti      (atheistic)

If joining bare stems together would result into a difficult consonant sequence,
a padding vowel **-o-** is inserted between them.

For example, this is how **termometer** (_thermometer_) is made:

         term       (temperature)
       +    o       (padding vowel)
       +  met       (measuring)
       +   er       (device)
    ____________
    = termometer    (thermometer)

## Function Words

_Function words_ are words that help to organize words into more or less complex sentences.
It is a closed class i.e. new words are never or only very seldom be added to it.
Function words behave by definition differently than _content words_,
which is the open class for words that refer to things in the world outside the structure of the language.

In Pandunia, function words have the following characteristics:

1. The word is made up of one consonant and one vowel.
2. The consonant indicates the general idea of the word.
3. The vowel has a structural meaning, as follows:
    - **-e** indicates a pronoun
    - **-i** indicates a determiner or a modifier
    - **-o** indicates an adverb
    - **-a** indicates a preposition
    - **-u** indicates a postposition
