## How to combine words

Two or more roots can be put together to make a _compound word_.
The last root is the most meaningful part in the compound
and the roots that come before it only modify its meaning.

Compound words are made of bare word stems and a vowel ending.

For example, this is how the word **andewisti** (atheistic) is made:

           an       (negation)
       +  deu       (god)
       +  ist       (proponent, -ist)
       +    i       (adjective ending)
    _____________
    = andevisti     (atheistic)

If joining bare stems together would result into a difficult consonant sequence,
a padding vowel **-o-** is inserted between them.

For example, this is how **termometer** (_thermometer_) is made:

         term       (temperature)
       +    o       (padding vowel)
       +  met       (measuring)
       +   er       (device)
    ____________
    = termometer    (thermometer)
