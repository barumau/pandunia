#### When was Pandunia created?

Creators of Pandunia began to create a language together first in 2005.
Since the beginning the basic idea was to create an evenly global
auxiliary language. Many different structures and ideas were tried
over the years. The name _Pandunia_ was invented already in 2007 but
the language got its "final" form in 2017 – but of course languages
evolve all the time!

#### What does the flag of Pandunia represent?

![](http://www.pandunia.info/bandir/bandir.png "The flag of Pandunia")

The flag of Pandunia represents global equality. There is a symbol of
_the blue planet_ against the background of the dark blue space. The
equality sign is laid over the Earth.

#### Why the mascot of Pandunia is a duck-billed platypus?

Platypus (**batokrote** in Pandunia) is an egg-laying, duck-billed,
beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal that lives in eastern Australia.
It is an unusual creature. That's why the platypus is a fitting
mascot for Pandunia, which is also an unusual mix, a mix of words and
grammar from East and West, from North and South.

Pandunia doesn't fit into any of the traditional types of languages.
Also in that regard it is similar to the platypus, which is of its own type.

## Past, present and future

#### I want to change something in Pandunia. What should I do?

If your change is a small thing, you should try it in practice with
other people and see how it works. If it really is a good change,
other people will accept it and use it.

Creating offshoot languages is very common in the auxiliary language
community. The case of Esperanto is famous. Offshoots of Esperanto
are counted in the hundreds but most people haven't even heard of
them. Esperanto is still the most popular language of its kind.

It is better to have one big language with several dialects than
many competing languages.

#### Which languages have influenced the grammar of Pandunia?

Pandunia has been influenced by both natural and constructed
languages.

- Natural languages with isolating grammar were a useful model. For
  example the pivot structure comes directly from Chinese.
- Works of earlier language makers were inspirational.
    - Esperanto, Ido, Novial etc. were closely examined.
    - Latino sine Flexione, Lingua Sistemfrater and Interglossa all
      have well thought-out isolating grammars.
- Natural contact languages gave many ideas. It is an interesting
  observation that when speakers of different languages come into
  contact, they tend to create extremely simplified grammar to
  overcome the language barrier — no matter how complex languages
  they speak natively.


#### Who made Pandunia?

The starter of Pandunia is _Risto Kupsala_ (born in Finland in 1979).
He is a language hobbyist and an engineer in information technology
who wants to help the world communicate better.
People from many countries have helped over the years.
There is a list of some of the contributors in
[GitHub](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/graphs/contributors).



## Auxiliary language

#### What is a worldlang?

A worldlang is a constructed interlanguage that borrows its words,
speech sounds and possibly grammar from different language families
of the world. There are many worldlangs. Some of them are listed
[here](http://www.kupsala.net/risto/tekokieli/worldlangs.html).

#### How does Pandunia differ from other auxiliary languages?

- The vocabulary of Pandunia is evenly global. It consists of Western
  (Greco-Latin) words, Perso-Arabic words, Chinese words and Indian
  words. Many other auxiliary languages use only or mostly Western
  words, which is not ideal for the world language in our opinion.
- Internationality is the main criterion for selecting words to
  Pandunia. All the words of Pandunia are known by many nations in
  some part of the world.
- The grammar of Pandunia is concise but very flexible. Pandunia has
  only a few grammatical structures, which are re-used over and over
  again.
- Pandunia is a truly neutral language. It's not meant to imitate any
  languages, whereas for example Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua are
  intentionally similar to the European languages.

#### Did Esperanto contribute to the birth of Pandunia?

At first Esperanto was an important source of inspiration. However
the influence of Esperanto to the final language is insignificant.
Pandunia has very different structure and vocabulary compared to
Esperanto.

#### Are the makers of Pandunia aware of the history of the IAL movement?

Yes. Here are some of the most important lessons to be learned from
the history of the international auxiliary language (IAL) movement.

- Over 99% of IALs do not survive in the long term.
- Languages that are created without any pre-existing model (so
  called _a priori_ languages) have very low chance of survival.
- Languages that imitate and simplify one or more natural languages
  have some chance of survival.
- Out of a group of many similar languages only one is likely to do
  well.
- Success can be short-lived. (Remember Volapük and Ido.)
- Rational reasons do not explain success. The "best" language
  doesn't necessarily win.
- Large international organizations, such as the UN or the EU, pay
  very little attention to IALs. So it is up to grassroots movements
  to push an IAL to success.


#### Should Pandunia replace English?

Pandunia is not meant to replace English or any other languages.
People have ability to speak several languages and they speak every
language for a different reason. Some people speak one language at
home, another at work and yet another on international travels. We
can imagine a world where English and all other languages will
continue to be spoken, and where Pandunia is spoken as the universal
second language.

In a way, English will never be replaced. Those who speak it today
will speak it tomorrow. But new generations will grow and they will
choose which language(s) they want to speak with each other. So it
will be _another world_ with another world language. Maybe it will be
English, or maybe a new kind of English or maybe something else. The
landscape of languages changes in a natural process. Different
languages were spoken in the past and different languages will be
spoken in the future.

You are free to speak Pandunia, English and any other language that
your heart desires.



## Letters and sounds

#### Is Pandunia's alphabet unique?

It is unique but not as odd as you might think. In fact,
the majority of letters (19 in total) are pronounced in general in
the way in Pandunia and English, 5 are different, and one (q)
is missing from Pandunia.

Most letters correspond to approximately similar sounds in Pandunia
and in other languages that use the Latin alphabet in their spelling
or their standard way of Romanization.
 
The alphabet of Pandunia is compared to alphabets and Romanizations
used in other languages in the table below.

- Letters that correspond normally to approximately similar sounds
  in Pandunia and in the compared language are listed under SIMILAR.
  For example English g is considered similar to Pandunia g although
  there is the 'soft' g (as in _gel_) besides the more common 'hard'
  g (as in _get_) in English.
- Letters that Pandunia has but the compared language doesn't have
  are listed under MISSING.
- Letters that correspond usually to different sounds in Pandunia
  and in the compared language are listed under DIFFERENT.

## Grammar

#### Is Pandunia a pidgin or a creole?

Pidgins and creoles are _natural_ contact languages.
Pandunia is a _constructed_ contact language.
So the answer is no, Pandunia is not a real pidgin or a creole.
However, it is characterized by many of the same features as pidgins and creoles.

The following is a list of characteristic features of pidgins and creoles
that apply for Pandunia too.

1. Lack of grammatical complexity
   - No definite or indefinite article
   - Omission of the copula 'be'
   - Tense, aspect, modality and negation are not part of the verb.
   - Passive structures are not used.
2. Lack of morphological complexity
   - Nouns and pronouns are not inflected
   - Verbs are not inflected and tense is marked by separate words
3. Semantic transparency
   - Meaning of a word can be determined from the meanings of the parts of which the word is built.
4. Reduced vocabulary
   - Multifunctional words
   - All-purpose prepositions
5. Simple phonology
   - Avoid difficult sounds.
   - Use mostly simple syllable structures.
   - Prefer short words.
   - Tone is not used to distinguish words.

#### How word forms change in Pandunia?

In general, word forms can change in four ways.

1. Total change: go ⇒ went
2. Change in the stem: write ⇒ wrote
3. Change of an affix: electric ⇒ electron
4. Addition of an affix: man ⇒ manhood

In Pandunia, only 3. and 4. are used.
We can change the ending of a word,
so for example **loge** (_speech_) can be changed to **loga** (_to speak_).
We can also add suffixes,
so for example **insania** (_humanity_) can be created from **insan** (_human being_).

#### Why word forms change in Pandunia?

Pandunia uses different word forms to indicate different word classes.
There are many good sides:

- Learning the grammar is very easy because
  the essentials of the grammar are encoded visibly and audibly in words.
- You can understand the structure of a sentence without knowing the meaning of all words.
- You don't have to memorize the word class with each word separately
  – words include that information in the last vowel!
- Word derivation is symmetric because word stems are neutral in Pandunia.
   - A word stem becomes a verb, a noun or a modifier only when the corresponding vowel ending is added.
   - Even transitive and intransitive verbs are symmetric in Pandunia,
     so we always know is the subject the agent or the recipient of the action.

Word class marking is a very efficient method to realize a functional grammar.
It is done in Pandunia with a minimal set of only four endings.
(In comparison, Esperanto employs 10 basic and 7 combined endings.)

#### Why agglutinating structure was chosen for Pandunia?

Different structures were considered and tested during the
development of Pandunia. The main choice was between an agglutinating
and an isolating structure.

1. In an agglutinating language every word can be clearly divided
   into component parts. For example Esperanto word "niaj" (our) is
   made out of three parts: ni- (we), -a- (adjective marker) and -j
   (plural marker).
2. In an isolating language every word consists of just one part. For
   example in Mandarin Chinese the word for "our" consists of three
   separate words: wǒ (first person pronoun), men (plural marker) and
   de (possessive marker). Then they are simply put together:
   wǒmende, 我们的.

Pandunia is a lightly agglutinating language. It uses separate words
to express things like person, number, mood, tense and aspect, which
are typically expressed with inflection in agglutinating and
inflecting languages.

To demonstrate the difference, let's compare the same sentence in
Esperanto (a heavily agglutinating language) and Pandunia. Parts of
word are separated with the vertical bar sign.

    Esperanto: Mi vol|as  vid|i  vi|a|j|n  du  bel|a|j|n  okul|o|j|n  nun.
    Pandunia:  me vol|a   vid|a  t|i       dul|i sundar|i kan|e       zay|o.
               I  want to see    your      two beautiful  eyes        now.

#### Are the word class markers unnatural?

Pandunia uses final vowels as word class markers.
It is not an unnatural thing to do
because there are comparable morphemes in natural languages
that are used for marking various word classes and their subclasses.

For example, the Bantu languages use a system of prefixes for marking nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.
Here are some Swahili words together with the same words in Pandunia.

| Pandunia | Swahili | English meaning |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| kitab-   | -and- | the root related to writing |
| kitaba   | ku-and-ik-a | to write |
| kitabu   | ku-and-ik-w-a | to be written |
| kitabe   | ma-and-ish-i | writing, text |
| kitabi   | -a ma-and-ish-i | written, textual |

Another example, Arabic uses a system of vowel infixes to convert consonant roots into different word classes and their subclasses.
Here are some Arabic words together with the same words in Pandunia.

| Pandunia | Arabic | English meaning |
|----------|---------|-----------------|| kitab- | k-t-b | the root related to writing | 
| kitaba   | kataba | to write |
| kitabu   | kutiba | to be written |
| kitabe   | kitāb | writing, text, book |
| kitabi   | kitābi | written, textual |

Pandunia's system is a very simple one – it includes only the bare minimum! – but otherwise it's nothing new.
Various natural languages have comparable morphemes for marking words in different word classes.
The morpheme type doesn't matter: prefixes, infixes, circumfixes and suffixes can do the same task.
Single-vowel suffixes are the most minimal and therefore the simplest type!

Looking at the examples above, it's obvious that the system of Pandunia is simpler than those of Swahili and Arabic.
English is the least systematic as it uses sometimes independent words (to, to be) and sometimes suffixes (-en, -ing, -al) as markers.

In conclusion, using the vowel suffixes for word class markers is unnatural only for its simplicity, nothing else.


## Vocabulary

#### Where Pandunia's words come from?

Pandunia's words come from all parts of the world.

In our opinion the world language should be a mix of all languages
in the world. That's why Pandunia has at least a few words in common
with almost all languages of the world.

A lot of words are in common to international and important regional
languages.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/leksasle.png "Source languages")


#### Why Pandunia borrows words mainly from widely spoken languages?

About 6500 languages are spoken in the world today. It would be
possible to borrow one and _only one_ word from every language.
But it wouldn't be very useful, if you knew only one or two words in
the world language beforehand, would it?

It's smarter to borrow words that are in common to many languages.
Then most people will know many words in Pandunia.

There are common words in every region of the world. For example,
in Europe there are European international words, which often come
from important ancient languages like Latin and Greek.
In the Indian peninsula there are ancient words from Sanskrit that
are in common to every language of that region.

That's why it is enough that we select some languages from every
part of the world. They represent also the other languages of that
region.

#### Why the last vowel of words is sometimes different in Pandunia than in language X?

In Pandunia, words consist of a stem and one or more suffixes.
A suffix is a part of word that belongs to the end.
The final vowel of a word has a grammatical meaning in Pandunia.
That's the basic reason why the final vowels are sometimes different in Pandunia than in other languages.

The second reason is that Pandunia borrows words from many languages,
and often those languages don't agree about the final vowel.
For example the word **supe** (_soup_) ends in -a in Spanish _sopa_,
in -u in Japanese スープ or _sūpu_,
in -e in German _Suppe_,
and not in any vowel in English _soup_.
So it's not one and the same word but rather an international family of similar words,
and Pandunia's **supe** fits perfectly into that family.

The third reason is that endings of words change already in many source languages.
For example, Pandunia word **novi** is borrowed, among others, from Portuguese.
In Portuguese, this word has many forms and only the stem nov- remains the same:
_nov|o, nov|a, nov|os, nov|as, nov|idade, re|nov|ar_...
So it makes sense to take only the stem and attach our regular Pandunia suffixes to it.

#### Shouldn't "salam" mean "peace"?

In many languages, expressions of greeting have something to do with
peace, health or well-being. The origins of Pandunia's word **salam**
can be traced back to Semitic triliteral root SLM, which covers a
variety of meanings including safety, security, peace and health.
Likewise the English word _salutation_ (and French greeting _salut_)
can be traced back to Latin "salus", which means safety, security,
health and well-being.

So the meaning of **salam** is greater than the meaning of peace. It
means well-being in general and you can use it as a general
expression for well-wishing in all kinds of situations, not just when
you meet somebody. See the first lesson in the [phrasebook](fraze.md)
for a lot of examples!

#### Why Pandunia doesn't have a verb like "to be"?

"To be" is a multi-purpose verb in English. It has many unrelated
meanings.

1. to be the same as, ex. _I am a man._
2. to have a quality, ex. _I am young._
3. to exist, ex. _I am._
4. to occupy a place, ex. _I am at home._
5. to have an age, ex. _I am 20._
6. to undergo, ex. _I am loved._
7. to do at present, ex. _I am watching you._

Pandunia has different ways to say these things. Sometimes there's
no need for a mediating verb at all, and sometimes the Pandunia verb'
is more precise than the multi-purpose "to be" would have been.

1. **me jovani.** = I am young.
2. **me man.** = I am a man.
3. **me zayu.** = I exist.
4. **me sa dom.** = I am at home.  
   **me loku dom.** = I occupy home.
5. **me umuru 20 nen.** = I am 20 years.
6. **me amu.** = I am loved.
7. **me zay kana te.** = I am watching you.
