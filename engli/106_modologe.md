# Adverbs

## Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia adverbs end in **-o** and their place is before a verb
or at the end of the sentence.

**me _bono_ sona.**
– I well sleep.  
**me sona _bono_.**
– I sleep _well_.  
**te basha pandunia _bono_.**
– You speak Pandunia _well_.

## Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier.
For example **day** (big) and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

**dayi jan**
– a big person  
**lili jan**
– a little person  
**sundari jan**
– a beautiful person

**dayo sundari jan**
– very beautiful person  
**lilo sundari jan**
– somewhat beautiful person

- **min**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
