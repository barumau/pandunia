# Adverbs

## Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia adverbs end in **-o** and their place is before a verb
or at the end of the sentence.

**me _bono_ sona.**
– I well sleep.  
**me sona _bono_.**
– I sleep _well_.  
**te baxa pandunia _bono_.**
– You speak Pandunia _well_.

## Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier.
For example **day** (big) and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

**dayi jan**
– a big person  
**lili jan**
– a little person  
**sundari jan**
– a beautiful person

**dayo sundari jan**
– very beautiful person  
**lilo sundari jan**
– somewhat beautiful person


## Comparison

Modifiers can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- **max**
  (_more_) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim**
  (_most_) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim**
  (_least_) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **paro**
  (_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**ka**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple sa max boni ka oranje.**
= Apples are better than oranges.  
**oranje sa min boni ka aple.**
= Oranges are less good than apples.  
**te loga paro bono ka me.**
= You speak as well as me.

It is also possible to compare modifiers with the following verbs,
which are directly attached to the object of comparison.

- **maxu**
  (_to exceed_)
- **minu**
  (_to subceed_)
- **paru**
  (_to equal_)

**aple sa boni maxu oranje.**
– Apples are good, exceed oranges. _meaning:_ Apples are better than oranges.  
**oranje sa boni minu aple.**
– Oranges are good, subceed apples. _meaning:_ Oranges are less good than apples.  
**te loga bono para me.**
– You speak well, equal me. _meaning:_ You speak as well as me.
