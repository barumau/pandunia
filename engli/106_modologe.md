# Adverbs

There are two types of adverbs in Pandunia,
adverbs of degree
and adverbs of comparison.

## Adverbs of degree

Adverbs of degree tell us about the intensity of something.

**tre**
– very  
**tai**
– too  
**bas**
– quite, sufficiently, enough  
**max**
– more  
**min**
– less

Adverbs of degree are placed before the adjective that they modify.

**un dai man**
– a big man  
**un tre dai man**
– a very big man  
**un tai dai man**
– a too big man  
**un bas dai man**
– a big enough man / a sufficiently big man

The adverb and adjective can together modify a verb or a phrase.

**mo _tre bon_ sona.**
– I very well sleep.  
**mo sona _tre bon_.**
– I sleep _very well_.  


## Adverbs of comparison

Adjectives can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- **max**
  (_more_) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim**
  (_most_) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim**
  (_least_) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **par**
  (_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**ka**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple si max bon ka oranje.**
= Apples are better than oranges.  
**oranje si min bon ka aple.**
= Oranges are less good than apples.  
**ni loga par bon ka mo.**
= You speak as well as me.
