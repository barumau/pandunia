Grammar
=======

## 0. Introduction

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in Pandunia. However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading this grammar, for example with the help of a phrasebook and a dictionary.



## 1. Pronunciation

### 1.1. Alphabet

Pandunia uses unaccented letters of the Latin alphabet to represent its sounds. Alphabetical order is standard. Only lower-case letters are used as the standard. Upper-case letters may be used at will.

### 1.2. Vowels

Pandunia has five pure vowels.

     a : low back unrounded         (English approx.: fAther)
     e : lower-mid front unrounded  (English approx.: pEt)
     i : high front unrounded       (English approx.: machIne)
     o : upper-mid back rounded     (English approx.: nOte)
     u : high back rounded          (English approx.: rUle)

The vowels are pure. Don't turn them into diphthongs or reduce them in unstressed syllables.

### 1.2. Consonants

     b : bilabial stop, voiced
     p : bilabial stop, unvoiced
     f : labio-dental fricative, unvoiced
     v : labio-dental fricative, voiced
     m : bilabial nasal, voiced
     d : dental or alveolar stop, voiced
     t : dental or alveolar stop, unvoiced
     s : linguo-alveolar fricative, unvoiced (sibilant)
     z : linguo-alveolar fricative, voiced (sibilant)
     n : dental or alveolar nasal, voiced
     c : palatal or retroflex fricative, unvoiced (sibilant)
     j : palatal or retroflex fricative, voiced (sibilant)
     g : velar stop, voiced
     k : velar stop, unvoiced
     h : velar or glottal fricative, unvoiced
     l : linguo-alveolar lateral
     r : linguo-palatal retroflex trill or glide

### 1.3. Stress Accent

The stress accent is on the vowel before the last consonant of a word.

1. Words with only one syllable carry the stress. Ex. MAU, TONG.
2. The stress is on the last syllable in words that end with a consonant. Ex. koMUN, baZAR, kaMIS.
3. The stress is on the second last syllable in words that end with a vowel. Ex. DUnia, meLOdi

> **dúnia ye memén ge sundár planét.**  
> **mé vól lóga komún báxe yáni pandúnia.**  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Nouns

### 2.1. Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing. Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant. So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

> **batu** - a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
> **meza** - a table, tables, the table or the tables  
> **kursi** - a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
> **su** - water

Quite often number and definiteness is known because it was specified earlier or because it is general knowledge. For example, normally the word **surya** refers to _the sun_ and **luna** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and our only moon.

### 2.2. Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in singular and plural.

An easy way to emphasize plurality is to repeat the noun.

> **batu batu** - stones, lots of stones  
> **tara tara** - stars, lots of stars  

### 2.3. Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine and/or neuter categories).

Some words carry _natural gender_. For example **fem** (woman) is feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.

### 2.4. Compounds

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word. The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

> **surya guang** - sun light  
> **luna guang** - moon light  
> **luna batu** - moon stone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to the thing denoted by another word, ex. good, bad, big, fast.

### 3.1. Adjectives

#### 3.1.1. General

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun. In Pandunia adjectives are usually before the noun that they modify.

> **day batu** - big stone
> **day meza** - big table  
> **alti meza** - high table
> **bon kursi** - good chair

Adjectives can be also after the noun.

> **batu day.** - stone big  
> **meza alti.** - table high

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

> **day meza alti** - big table high


#### 3.1.3. Adjective endings

Adjectives end in **-i** by default. The ending is used always with words that are derived from action roots and thing roots. Ex. **logi** _spoken_, **suki** _pleasant_, **kitabi** _written_.

The ending is not applied to description roots that end in a single consonant that is easy to pronounce. Ex. **bon** _good_, **sundar** _beautiful_.

Some suffixes are also adjectival by default. These include **-al**. Ex. **social** _societal_.



### 3.2 Adverbs

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, an adjective or another adverb.

Adverbs of manner are next to the verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **me _bono_ sona.** - I well sleep.  
> **me sona _bono_.** - I sleep _well_.  
> **ni baxa pandunia _bono_.** - You speak Pandunia _well_.


#### 3.2.2. Adverb ending

Adverbs of manner end in **-o**: **bono** _well_, **sundaro** _beautifully_.


### 3.3. Comparison

Both adjectives and adverbs can be compared.

- **max** (more) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim** (most) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min** (less) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim** (least) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **sem** (as) indicates the comparison of equality

Particle **ka** relates the adverbs of comparison to the point of comparison.

> **me ye max bon ka ni.** - I am better than you.  
> **ni loga sem bono ka me.** - You speak as well as me.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Numerals

Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about. For example, the word **surya** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words. They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

> **un tara** - one star  
> **du tara** - two stars  
> **sam tara** - three stars  
> **xau tara** - few stars  
> **poli tara** - many stars

> **un dai meza** - one big table  
> **du dai kursi** - two big chairs  
> **sem bon kursi** - three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

> **fen un** - the first part (part one)
> **fen du** - the second part (part two)
> **fen sam** - the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nul**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **du**
- 3 **sam**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **set**
- 8 **bat**
- 9 **noi**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another – exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nul** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un du**
- 13 **un sam**
- 20 **du nul**
- 21 **du un**
- 22 **du du**
- 100 **un nul nul** or **hon**
- 101 **un nul un** or **hon un**
- 200 **du nul nul** or **du hon**


Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units. So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    


## 5. Pronouns

### 5.1. Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute thing-words and phrases of thing-words.

**me** - I, me  
**ni** - you  
**ta** - he, she, it  
**memen** - we  
**nimen** - you all  
**tamen** - they

**se** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons, so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**me vida se** - I see myself.
**ta vida se** - She sees herself. / He sees himself.
**memen vida se.** - We see ourselves.


### 5.2. Demonstrative pronouns

**Sa** is the general demonstrative pronoun. It covers the meaning of both _this_ and _that_.

The distance to the speaker can be specified by adding words **jin** (near) and **far** (far), if needed.

**sa** - this or that  
**sa jin** - this over here  
**sa far** - that over there  

The demonstrative pronouns work like modifiers.

> **sa batu.** - That stone  
> **sa e batu.** - That is a stone.  
> **sa batu cung.** - That stone is heavy.  


### 5.3. Interrogative pronoun

**Ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun. It does the job of English words _who, what_ and _which_.

> **ke?** - Who or what?  
> **ke xe?** - What? (Which thing?)  
> **ke yen?** - Who? (Which person?)  
> **ke sat?** - When? (What time?)  
> **ke yang?** - How? (What manner?)  
> **ke koz?** - Why? (What cause?)  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Verbs

#### 6.1. General

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.

Pandunia has two types of verb: verbs that end in **-a** and verbs that end in **-u**. The endings decide the order of the other constituents (subject and object) in the sentence. So the sentence structure depends on the type of the verb.

#### 6.2. Verbs that end in -a

Verbs that end in **-a** use this triangular pattern.

    Word order triangle for verbs that end in -a
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    S ← O

#### 6.2.1. SVO order

The most common word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object (SVO). In this sentence structure the subject comes first, the verb second, and the object third.

    subject-verb-object
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    S   O

Examples:  
**me vida tamen.** - I see them.  
**ni baka pan.** - You bake bread.  

#### 6.2.2. OSV order

The second structure in this triangle is OSV. It is frequent in dependant clauses.

    object-subject-verb
    
      V
     ↗ 
    S ← O

For example: **me yem pan, jo ni baka.** - I eat bread _that you baked._

#### 6.2.3. VOS order

The third structure of this triangle is VOS, which is rarely used.

    verb-object-subject
    
      V
       ↘
    S ← O



#### 6.3. Verbs that end in -u

Verbs that end in **-u** use this triangular pattern.

    Word order triangle for verbs that end in -u
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    O ← S

#### 6.3.1. SOV order

SOV order is commonly used alternative for SVO order.

    subject-object-verb
    
      V
     ↗ 
    O ← S

Examples:  
**me tamen vidu.** - _I them see._  
**ni pan baku.** - _You bread bake._

#### 6.3.2. OVS order

OVS order is common in "passive" sentences.

    object-verb-subject
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    O   S

Examples:  
**pan baku ni.** - Bread is baked by you.  
**ni suku me.** - You are delighted by me.

#### 6.3.3. VSO order

VSO order is very rare but possible.

    verb-subject-object
    
      V
       ↘
    O ← S

### 6.3. Passive sentences

In passive sentence there is only object and verb but no subject (i.e. agent).

> **me vidu.** - I am seen.  
> **pan baku.** - Bread is baked.  
> **kop kasaru.** - Cup breaks. (Cup gets broken.)

### 6.4. Verb endings

Most verbs end in **-a** and **-u**. A handful of verbs are without a standard ending.






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Sentences

### 8.1. Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type. They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention to it.

> **mau!** - A cat!  
> **pluva!** - (It) rains!  


### 8.2. Stative Sentences


#### 8.2.1. With pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. In the simplest sentences, the subject is a personal pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

> **me bon.** - I am good.  
> **ta novi.** - It is new.  
> **ta sara.** - She is Sara.  

The word **no** is added to form the negative.

> **me no bon.** - I'm not good.  
> **ta no novi.** - It's not new.  
> **ta no sara.** - She is not Sara.

Also two personal pronouns can be juxtaposed.

> **me ye ta.** - I am he/she.  
> **me no ni.** - I'm not you.

#### 8.2.2. With noun subject

When the subject is a noun, the word **ye** (yes) is added before the predicate in positive sentences. The negative sentences use **no** like above.

> **sara ye bon.** - Sara is good.  
> **batu ye day.** - The stone is big.  
> **meza ye novi.** - The table is new.  
> **meza no purani.** - The table is not old.


#### 8.2.3. With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

> **jovan ye sundar.** - Young is beautiful.  
> **novi no purani.** - New is not old.  

#### 8.2.4. To be

Pandunia doesn't use a verb like "to be" in English.



### 8.3. Active Sentences

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is a verb (i.e. an action-word). In Pandunia, verbs are easy to identify because most of them end in **-a** or **-u**.

Active sentences that use a verb ending in **-a** have the subject–verb–object word order (SVO).

> **me yem pingo.** - I eat apples.  
> **me auda musik.** - I hear music.  
> **me vida ni.** - I see you.

Verbs ending in **-u** are used in the subject–object–verb word order (SOV).

**me pingo yemu.** - _I apples eat._

SOV and SVO are the two most common word orders by far in the languages of the world. SOV is used in languages like Hindi-Urdu, Tamil, Turkish, Japanese and Korean. SVO is used in English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Indonesian and Modern Arabic among others.


### 8.4. Passive Sentences

#### 8.4.1. OV order

In the passive voice there is no agent subject in the sentence. There is only the object and the verb. Normally the passive is expressed with object–verb (VO) word order with the verb ending in **-u**.

> **ni vidu.** - You are seen.  
> **musik audu.** - Music is heard.  
> **pan baku.** - Bread is baked.  

Here the focus is on the object, which is the first word in the sentence. The object is a passive actor that undergoes the action.

The agent can be mentioned after the verb with or without the preposition **de**.

> **ni vidu me.** - You are seen by me.  
> **ni vidu de me.** - You are seen by me.


#### 8.4.2. OV order

In verb–object (VO) order the focus is on the verb.

> **vida ni.** - Seeing you.  
> **auda musik.** - Listening music.  
> **baka pan.** - Baking bread.


#### 8.5. All Possible Word Orders

There are six possible word orders for the transitive sentence. In practice, all of them are possible in Pandunia. They are made possible by the two verb endings, which decide the order of the other constituents (subject and object).

Different orders put the focus on different constituents: the subject, the object or the verb. The focus or emphasis is on the first part of a sentence.

    1. With the verb ending in -a
        - object–subject–verb (OSV) : musik mi auda.
        - subject–verb–object (SVO) :       mi auda musik.
        - verb–object–subject (VOS) :          auda musik mi.
    2. With the verb ending in -u
        - subject-object-verb (SOV) : mi musik audu.
        - object-verb-subject (OVS) :    musik audu mi.
        - verb-subject-object (VSO) :          audu mi musik.

The constituent, which is further away from the verb, can be left out. So for example **musik me auda** (OSV) can be truncated to **me auda** (SV). Likewise **me musik audu** (SOV) can be truncated to **musik audu** (OV).

The typical word orders in everyday Pandunia are SVO, SOV and OSV. The other word orders can be heard in poetry and in other forms of literary language.


### 8.6. Pivot structure

#### 8.6.1. Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  
subject – verb 1 – object 1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 functions has dual role. It is at the same time the object for verb 1 and the subject for verb 2.

> **me vol ni yem sabze.** - I want you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **me vol** has **ni** as its object. At the same time, **ni** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **yem sabze**. So **ni** is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.


### 8.7. Serial verbs

All action-words (verbs) that come one after another are activated by the subject. There can be two, three or even more action-words in series.
 
1. **me go dom.** - I go home.  
2. **me ken go dom.** - I can go home.  
3. **me vol ken go dom.** - I want to be able to go home. (Lit. _I want can go home_!)


### 8.8. Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity. This is done especially in commands and requests.

#### 8.8.2. Short pivot structure (VOVO)

> **me kia ni baxa pandunia.** - I ask do you speak Pandunia.  
> **kia ni baxa pandunia?** - Do you speak Pandunia.

#### 8.8.3. Short pivot structure (VVO)

> **me cing ni lay dom.** - I ask you to come home.  
> **cing lay dom!** - Please come home! (Literally: _Request come home!_)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Particles


### 9.1. Affirmation and Negation

### 9.1.1. Affirmative

Particle **ye** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **Ye** affirms the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it. In other words **ye** means "to be" or "there is" and **no** means "not to be" or "there is not".

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **ye** is not always necessary. However it is especially convenient in expressions of state.

> **me ye yen.** - I am a person.  
> **ta ye novi meza.** - It is a new table.

### 9.1.2. Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

> **me no yen.** - I'm not a person.  
> **ta no novi meza.** - It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.

> **me vida ni.** - I see you.  
> **me no vida ni.** - I don't see you.  
> **me vida no ni ama tamen.** - I see, not you, but them.

The particles **ye** and **no** are used also for answering questions.

> **kia ni vida me?** - Do you see me?  
> **ye. (me vida ni.)** - Yes. (I see you.)  
> **no. (me no vida ni.)** - No. (I don't see you.)



### Modifier particles

Particles **ge** and **de** are used to mark possession and modification. **Ge** connects the modifying word or phrase to the modified word. **De** works in the opposite direction. It connects the modified word to the modifier.

#### 9.2.1. Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **ge** works like apostrophe-s ('s) in English.

> **maria ge mama** - Maria's mother  
> **me ge bet** - my house  
> **me ge papa ge bet** - my father's house

**De** works like "of" in English.

> **mama de maria** - the mother of Maria
> **bet de me** - the house of mine  
> **bet de papa de me** - the house of the father of mine

#### 9.2.2. Attribution with adjectives

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun. It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

> **roza rang ge lab** - rose-colored lips  
> **saman rang ge mat** - sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

> **lab de roza rang** - lips of the color of the rose  
> **mat de saman rang** - eyes of the color of the sky

#### 9.2.3. Relative clauses

Also relative clauses are created with help of the modifier particles.

Here **de** has a similar role as English relative pronouns _which_, _that_, _who_ and _whom_.

> **ta ye man _de me vida_.** - He is the man _that I saw_.

If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object (i.e. if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause.

> **me vida man _de yem pingo_.** - I see a man _who eats apples_.  

It's possible to construct relative clauses with **ge** too. Then the relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. The verb is turned into a modifier by putting **ge** immediately after the verb.

> **me vida _pingo yemu ge_ man.** - I see an _apple-eating_ man.



### 9.3. Modal Particles

Modal particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in relation to the listener. Modal particles are commonly used in many languages. East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a modal particle modifies the subsequent word, or the whole sentence, when the modal particle is the last word in the sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions much like in English.

> **ta yem bir plus.** - S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
> **ta yem plus bir.** - S/he drinks _also beer_.  
> **ta plus yem bir.** - S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
> **plus ta yem bir.** - _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Modal particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.


### 9.4. Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed. The general time words are **gon** (past), **nun** (present) and **futur** (future). They function like adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **me ha mau gon.** - I had cats in the past.
> **ama me no ha mau nun.** - But I don't have cats now.
> **munkin me ha mau futur.** - Maybe I have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated. So the verb **ha** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary. Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Prepositions

### 10.1. Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has three prepositions of place and time.

1. **na** - location or moment (in general): at, in, on, during
2. **ze** - origin or beginning: from, since
3. **do** - destination or end: to, till, until

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

> **me lay dom.** - I come home.  
> **ni sit kursi.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
> **ta lala sofa.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
> **maci nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
> **janger marca dau.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

> **me na hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
> **me son na hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
> **me son ze cam do suba.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
> **me safar ze london do paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they refer to time.

> **me deng ze ni go.** - I have waited since you left.  
> **me deng do ni lay dom.** - I wait until you come home.  
> **me deng na ni son.** - I wait while you sleep.  

More precise expressions of place and time are expressed with _a preposition + a place word + **de**_.

> **na dur de** - for the time/duration of  
> **me deng na dur de ni son.** - I wait for the time when you sleep.  
> **na lok de** - at the place of  
> **me deng na lok de ni toka.** - I wait at the place where you left.  
> **na xia de** - under, below  
> **un waf lala na xia de meza.** - A dog lies under the table.  
> **na par de** - on the surface of  
> **un mau lala na par de meza.** - A cat lies on the table.

Similar meaning can be expressed also with compound words.

> **un mau lala na meza par.** - A cat lies at the tabletop.

In addition, a preposition can be followed immediately by a verb.

> **dur** - to last, to take time
> **me deng na dur de ni son.** - _I wait during you sleep._


### 10.2. Prepositions of manner

Preposition **bi** indicates means. It corresponds to English prepositions _with_ and _by (by means of)_. The meaning of **bi** is very broad. Often it is followed by another word that defines the meaning more precisely.

> **me kata pan bi caku.** - I cut bread with a knife.  
> **me kata pan bi uza caku.** - I cut bread by using a knife.

Prepositions **ka** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

> **me saba pandunia ka guru.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**Ka** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In the above example **sabi** (know) is the verb and **guru** (master) is the point of comparison.

**Ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

> **ban ye min dai ka papa.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
> **opa ye sem dai ka papa.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**Ka** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min** (less) and **sem** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is **papa** (father) in the examples above.




### 10.3. List of compound prepositions

**na ante** before. **na bada** after.  
**na cen** in front. **na pice** behind.  
**na xia** under, below. **na gau** over, above.  
**na jin** near. **na far** far away. **na visin** beside, next to.




## 11. Word Building

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia. Pandunia has a productive system of word derivation. Most of the suffixes that are used in Pandunia are already in international use. Many of hem come from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.

### 11.1. Part of speech markers

Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation. In this system the final vowel of a word marks the type of the word. The system applies mainly to those words, which are derived from verb roots and adjective roots. Some adjectives are also derived from nouns.

Dynamic verbs end in **-a** and **-u**. From the narrow perspective of a phrase that consists of only a subject and a verb, it can be said that **-a** marks an active verb and **-u** marks a passive verb. So **loga** means _to speak_ and **logu** means _to be spoken_.

**-i** is the marker of adjective and adjectival verb (i.e. static verb). For example, from the verb **loga** (to speak) we get the adjective **logi** (spoken, wordy). From the noun **manux** (human being), we get the adjective **manuxi** (human, having the attributes of a human being). However, only derived adjectives need to end in **-i**. Words that are adjectives _by nature_ don't need the ending. That's why for example **nov** (new) and **sundar** (beautiful) are without the ending.

There are two simple vowel endings for nouns. **-o** means the process and **-e** means the result of the process. So **logo** means the _act of speaking_ and **loge** means the _speech_ that results from the action. Quite often **-e** is left out and so **log** means the same thing as **loge**.

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of word from another. An ending is simply changed to another ending.

Here are some examples.

**loga** - to speak (active verb)  
**logu** - to be spoken (passive verb)  
**logi** - spoken, wordy (adjective)  
**loge** or **log** - speech, word(s) (noun)  

**kitaba** - to write (active verb)  
**kitabu** - to be written (passive verb)  
**kitabi** - written, textual (adjective)  
**kitabe** or **kitab** - writing, text (noun)  

**nov** or **novi** - new (adjective)  
**novo** - newly (adverb)  
**nova** - to make new (active verb)  
**novu** - to become new (passive verb)  
**nove** - novelty, new thing (noun)  

There is a handful of verbs, which appear without the ending. These are some of the most common verbs in Pandunia.

**hav** or **hava** - to have (active verb)  
**havu** - to belong (passive verb)  
**have** - that what is had (noun)  

**mus** - to must, to be compelled (passive verb)  
**musa** - to compel (active verb)  
**musi** - compulsory, obligatory  




Pandunia has a system of word derivation with final vowels that is applied on action roots and description roots. Usually it's not applied on thing roots and name roots, and also pronouns, conjuctions, numerals and particles are unaffected. However there are exceptions.

- **a** marks verbs for subject-verb-object word order (SVO)
- **u** marks verbs for object-verb-subject word order (OVS)
- **i** marks adjectives i.e. modifiers of nouns
- **o** marks adverbs i.e. modifiers of verbs, adjectives and other adverbs
- **e** marks nouns that are derived from action roots and description roots

#### 11.1.2. Deriving verbs

1. If the root is an action, then its verbal form will mean "to do the action". For example from **vide** = "a look" we get **vida** = "to look".
2. If the root is a description, like **nov-** (**novi** = new), then its verbal form will mean "to turn into that quality". For example from **novi** = "new" we get **nova** = "to make new" or "to renew".
3. If the root is some kind of tool or apparatus, then its verbal form will mean "to use the tool (in usual manner)". For example **hamar** (hammer) gives **hamara** = "to hammer".

#### 11.1.3. Deriving modifiers

If the root word is a description, then it's adjectival form will mean "that which is in the state of the root". For example from **nov-** = quality of novelty, we get **novi** = _new_ i.e. _that which is new_. The corresponding adverb will be **novo** = _newly_ or _in a new way_.

If the root is an action, then its adjectival form will mean the state that is produced by the action. For example from **loga** = "to speak" we get **logi** = "spoken". The corresponding adverb will be **logo** = _in a spoken way_, _orally_.

If the root is a thing, an object or a person, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is somehow related to the root". The definition is loose and it is meant to be loose.

### 11.2. Derivational Suffixes

#### 11.2.1. -al

**norme** norm, rule; **normal** normal, regular, that which is in concordance with norms and rules.  
**tabia** nature; **tabial** natural, that which is in concordance with the nature.

#### 11.2.2. -an

When applied to action roots, it denotes the active participant of the action.

**loga** to speak; **logan** speaking, the one who speaks  
**vida** to see; **vidan** seeing, the one who sees

**europa** Europe; **europan** European  
**asia** Asia; **asian** Asian
**rusia** Russia; **rusian** Russian, of Russia  

#### 11.2.3. -er

### Sentence Word Orders

In theory, there are six possible word orders for the transitive sentence. In practice, all of them are possible in Pandunia. They are made possible by the two verb endings, which decide the order of the other constituents (subject and object).

    1. With the verb ending in -a
        - object–subject–verb (OSV) : musik mi auda.
        - subject–verb–object (SVO) :       mi auda musik.
        - verb–object–subject (VOS) :          auda musik mi.
    2. With the verb ending in -u
        - subject-object-verb (SOV) : mi musik audu.
        - object-verb-subject (OVS) :    musik audu mi.
        - verb-subject-object (VSO) :          audu mi musik.

The constituent, which is further away from the verb, can be left out. So for example **musik me auda** (OSV) can be truncated to **me auda** (SV). Likewise **me musik audu** (SOV) can be truncated to **musik audu** (OV).

The typical word orders in everyday Pandunia are SVO, SOV and OSV. The latter occurs frequently in dependant clauses, for example in **me vida yen, jo ti suka.** (I saw the person _whom you like_.) The other word orders can be heard in poetry and in other forms of literary language.


### Hierarchy of Word Types

Spoken language is a flow of sounds which constitute words. Written language, in the case of Pandunia, is a flow of letters from left to right, which constitute words. So every expression is essentially a sequence of words. However all words are not equal. There is a hierarchy of words. The verb is the structural center of a sentence and other words are directly or indirectly connected to it.

Each sentence can be drawn as a tree diagram, where the central words are above and the dependant words are below. For example the sentence **me vida ni** (I see you) can be pictured as a tree as follows.

    me vida ni.

       vida
      ┌─┴─┐
     me   ni

Adjectives and numerals point to their head word, the noun.

    me vida sam jovan yen.

       vida
      ┌─┴──┐
     me   yen
           |
         jovan
           |
          sam

The hierarchy of word types in Pandunia from the more to the less central is as follows.

1. Conjunctions: i, u
2. Connectors: ge, de
3. Coverbs (prepositions): na, do, ze, bi
4. Verbs
5. Nouns and pronouns
6. Tense, aspect and mood particles
7. Numerals
8. Adjectives

The following example shows how the scope affects the final position of words in the tree hierarchy. For example, although **i** is in general higher than **koz**, here its scope is only to connect **yusef** and **sara**. **Ze koz de** is at the top, because it connects the two sub-phrases.


    yusef i sara vol darsa pandunia ze koz de ta e bon dunia bax.

                      ze koz de
               ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              vol                    e
          ┌────┴──────┐           ┌──┴──┐
          i         darsa        ta    bax
      ┌───┴───┐    ┌──┴────┐            |
    yusef   sara       pandunia       dunia
                                        |
                                       bon

### Basic Rules

1. Every word is read as it is written. No letter is silent. Only the lower-case letters are necessary.
2. The stress accent is on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Nouns are unaffected by number or gender. They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.
4. When an adjective is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.
    - ex. **bon pan** = Good bread. **ta bon** = It (is) good.
5. Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them. The main word stands at the end.
    - ex. **poste sanduk** = mailbox
6. Sentences with active verbs have subject-verb-object word order. Most active verbs end in **-a**.
    - ex. **me penta meza.** = I paint tables.
7. A sentence with passive meaning has only a subject and a verb. Most passive verbs end in **-u**.
    - ex. **meza pentu.** = The table gets painted.
8. The object of a transitive verb can function as the subject of the next verb in the sentence. This structure is called the _pivot structure_.
    - ex. **me cing ni dar pesa.** = I ask you to give money.
9. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **me kia ni baxa pandunia?** → **kia ni baxa pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
    - **me cing ni loga klar.** →  **cing loga klar.** = Please speak clearer.
