#### When was Pandunia created?

Creators of Pandunia began to create a language together first in 2005.
Since the beginning the basic idea was to create an evenly global
auxiliary language. Many different structures and ideas were tried
over the years. The name _Pandunia_ was invented already in 2007 but
the language got its "final" form in 2021 – but of course languages
evolve all the time!

#### What does the flag of Pandunia represent?

![](http://www.pandunia.info/bandir/bandir.png "The flag of Pandunia")

The flag of Pandunia represents global equality. There is a symbol of
_the blue planet_ against the background of the dark blue space. The
equality sign is laid over the Earth.

#### Why the mascot of Pandunia is a duck-billed platypus?

Platypus (**batakrote** in Pandunia) is an egg-laying, duck-billed,
beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal that lives in eastern Australia.
It is an unusual creature. That's why the platypus is a fitting
mascot for Pandunia, which is also an unusual mix, a mix of words and
grammar from East and West, from North and South.

Pandunia doesn't fit into any of the traditional types of languages.
Also in that regard it is similar to the platypus, which is of its own type.

## Past, present and future

#### I want to change something in Pandunia. What should I do?

If your change is a small thing, you should try it in practice with
other people and see how it works. If it really is a good change,
other people will accept it and use it.

Creating offshoot languages is very common in the auxiliary language
community. The case of Esperanto is famous. Offshoots of Esperanto
are counted in the hundreds but most people haven't even heard of
them. Esperanto is still the most popular language of its kind.

It is better to have one big language with several dialects than
many competing languages.

#### Which languages have influenced the grammar of Pandunia?

Pandunia has been influenced by both natural and constructed
languages.

- Natural languages with isolating grammar were a useful model. For
  example the pivot structure comes directly from Chinese.
- Works of earlier language makers were inspirational.
    - Esperanto, Ido, Novial etc. were closely examined.
    - Latino sine Flexione, Lingua Sistemfrater and Interglossa all
      have well thought-out isolating grammars.
- Natural contact languages (so called _pidgins_ and _creoles_) gave many ideas.
  It is an interesting observation that when speakers of different languages come into contact,
  they tend to create extremely simplified grammar to overcome the language barrier
  — no matter how complex languages they speak natively.


#### Who made Pandunia?

The starter of Pandunia is _Risto Kupsala_ (born in Finland in 1979).
He is a language hobbyist and an engineer in information technology
who wants to help the world communicate better.
People from many countries have helped over the years.

## Auxiliary language

#### What is a worldlang?

A worldlang is a constructed interlanguage that borrows its words,
speech sounds and possibly grammar from different language families
of the world. There are many worldlangs. Some of them are listed
[here](http://www.kupsala.net/risto/tekokieli/worldlangs.html).

#### How does Pandunia differ from other auxiliary languages?

- The vocabulary of Pandunia is evenly global. It consists of Western
  (Greco-Latin) words, Perso-Arabic words, Chinese words and Indian
  words. Many other auxiliary languages use only or mostly Western
  words, which is not ideal for the world language in our opinion.
- Internationality is the main criterion for selecting words to
  Pandunia. All the words of Pandunia are known by many nations in
  some part of the world.
- The grammar of Pandunia is concise but very flexible. Pandunia has
  only a few grammatical structures, which are re-used over and over
  again.
- Pandunia is a truly neutral language. It's not meant to imitate any
  languages, whereas for example Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua are
  intentionally similar to the European languages.

#### Did Esperanto contribute to the birth of Pandunia?

At first Esperanto was an important source of inspiration.
However the influence of Esperanto to the final language is insignificant.
Pandunia has very different structure and vocabulary compared to Esperanto.

#### Are the makers of Pandunia aware of the history of the IAL movement?

Yes. Here are some of the most important lessons to be learned from
the history of the international auxiliary language (IAL) movement.

- Over 99% of IALs do not survive in the long term.
- Languages that are created without any pre-existing model (so
  called _a priori_ languages) have very low chance of survival.
- Languages that imitate and simplify one or more natural languages
  have some chance of survival.
- Out of a group of many similar languages only one is likely to do
  well.
- Success can be short-lived. (Remember Volapük and Ido.)
- Rational reasons do not explain success. The "best" language
  doesn't necessarily win.
- Large international organizations, such as the UN or the EU, pay
  very little attention to IALs. So it is up to grassroots movements
  to push an IAL to success.

#### Isn't it easier to just speak English instead?

English is indeed widely used
– even up to a degree that some would like to call it _the_ international language.
Unfortunately, English is not very good at being an international language.
It's not its own fault.
It just happens to be the case that natural languages,
including English, French, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin Chinese and most others,
are the products of very long, natural, undirected language evolution.
How things are said and written in these languages is more because of convention and tradition
than because of beauty, logic, simplicity and practicality.

There is also the viewpoint of fairness.
International communication should be fair, like a meeting where everybody get together half-way.
That's not the situation with English.
Native English speakers don't need to make any effort in learning the international language,
while everybody else has to spend years learning English in school or on their own.
Native English speakers are in a dominant position that they have gained just by their birth.
That's not fair.

This is mostly a result of political history.
Britain was once successful at invading and submitting other territories in the age of colonialism
and it imposed the English language on other peoples.
Although the power of Britain waned eventually,
its military, economic and cultural dominance was continued by another English speaking power, the United States, until today.

Native English speakers always have an advantage over non-native speakers
because they speak English fluently and they are aware of all the cultural nuances.
Native English speakers speak English perfecty by definition,
whereas non-native speakers speak it almost always with an accent
– and it's their job to lose that accent!
They also tend to make mistakes in grammar
and they often select their words poorly
because English vocabulary is huge, layered, and nuanced.

The table below summarizes the main points of difference between
English (a natural language)
and Pandunia (a constructed helping language).

#### Should Pandunia replace English?

Pandunia is not meant to replace English or any other languages.
People have ability to speak several languages and they speak every
language for a different reason. Some people speak one language at
home, another at work and yet another on international travels. We
can imagine a world where English and all other languages will
continue to be spoken, and where Pandunia is spoken as the universal
second language.

In a way, English will never be replaced. Those who speak it today
will speak it tomorrow. But new generations will grow and they will
choose which language(s) they want to speak with each other. So it
will be _another world_ with another world language. Maybe it will be
English, or maybe a new kind of English or maybe something else. The
landscape of languages changes in a natural process. Different
languages were spoken in the past and different languages will be
spoken in the future.

You are free to speak Pandunia, English and any other language that
your heart desires.


## Vocabulary

#### Why the last vowel of words is sometimes different in Pandunia than in language X?

The main reason is that Pandunia borrows words from many languages,
and often those languages don't agree about the final vowel.
For example the word **supe** (_soup_) ends in -a in Spanish _sopa_,
in -u in Japanese スープ (_sūpu_),
in -e in German _Suppe_,
and not in any vowel in English _soup_.
So it's not one and the same word but rather an international family of similar words,
and Pandunia's **supe** fits perfectly into that family.

#### Shouldn't "salam" mean "peace"?

In many languages, expressions of greeting have something to do with
peace, health or well-being. The origins of Pandunia's word **salam**
can be traced back to Semitic triliteral root SLM, which covers a
variety of meanings including safety, security, peace and health.
Likewise the English word _salutation_ (and French greeting _salut_)
can be traced back to Latin "salus", which means safety, security,
health and well-being.

So the meaning of **salam** is greater than the meaning of peace. It
means well-being in general and you can use it as a general
expression for well-wishing in all kinds of situations, not just when
you meet somebody. See the first lesson in the [phrasebook](200_baze_jumla.md)
for a lot of examples!
