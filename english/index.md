## What is Pandunia?

Pandunia is a globally sourced constructed language
that combines different types of grammar and international words from all continents into one language.
It is a perfect language to be learned as the first foreign language because it prepares students to study other foreign languages in a unique way.
Pandunia helps students to identify and use

- the basic word classes
- different word orders
- analytic and synthetic grammar
- word derivation and structure of international words
- widely known words from Western, Asian and African cultures.

One year of learning Pandunia produces a language ability equivalent to what the average learner reaches with other languages after several years of study.
It is a first stepping stone that builds confidence and improves the ability of the student to learn any other language in the future.

One year of learning Pandunia also enables students to communicate well with a growing number of people
who have also learned this regular, flexible and multicultural language.

## How Pandunia works?

Learning Pandunia is a course in basic linguistics by itself.
There are three structural types of Pandunia
that familiarize learners with the most common types and structures of languages.

1. *Analytic Pandunia* (AP) is the simplest type.
   It has only invariable words and it uses a fixed word order to arrange words in sentences.
2. *Middle Pandunia* (MP) is a compromise between the extreme types.
   It uses a system of *word class markers* to arrange words in sentences.
3. *Synthetic Pandunia* (SP) is the most complicated type.
   It changes the form of words when they are used in different ways in sentences.

The types are compatible with each other!
The most advanced type, Synthetic Pandunia, includes Middle Pandunia, which in turn includes Analytic Pandunia.

The best way to get familiar with the three types is to start from Middle Pandunia.
Middle Pandunia words consist of two parts:
the word stem and a *vowel ending* that indicates the word's part of speech.

- Every adjective ends in ***-i***.
- Every adverb ends in ***-o***.
- Every noun ends in ***-e*** or the *zero ending*.
- Every verb ends in ***-a*** or ***-u***.

Analytic Pandunia is made from Middle Pandunia by stripping off the vowel endings
and replacing them with the neutral vowel ending ***-É™*** or the zero ending.
Only the core stucture words, such as the pronouns, keep their original endings.
In the resulting simplified language, grammatical relations are expressed with a fixed word order instead of the word class markers.

Synthetic Pandunia is made from Middle Pandunia by combining several meaningful roots into one word,
such as person and tense into verbs and possessive pronouns into nouns.
So the sentence in a way collapses into a smaller number of words
because more information is encoded into individual words.

Below is a simple demonstration where the same sentence is written in the three types of Pandunia.
The units of meaning are written in different colors.

The three types of Pandunia can be used for different purposes.
Analytic Pandunia is the natural choice for communication in rudimentary levels.
People can learn this type easily on their own even without books or other learning materials.
Middle Pandunia is a good choice for literature, business and even legal documents.
Synthetic Pandunia can be used in artistic expression, for example poetry and proverbs.
