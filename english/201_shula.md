**halo!**
= Hello!  
<big>☻</big>
**salam!**
= Hello!  
<big>☺</big>
**tu si ke?**
= Who are you?  
<big>☻</big>
**mi si Yusef. tu si ke?**
= I am Yusef. Who are you?  
<big>☺</big>
**mi si Sara. ye si ke?**

<big>☺</big>
**ye su nam si ke?**

<big>☻</big>
**ye su nam si Maria.**
= Her name is Maria.

### Grammar

Pandunia's sentences normally follow the topic-comment structure. 
The topic indicates who or what is being talked about. The comment
tells something about the topic. For instance in
**ye si mi su dosti**
the topic is the pronoun **ye** (he, she, it), which is followed by the comment
**si mi su dosti**
(is my friend).

In Pandunia, the word **si** functions like _to be_ in English.
The same word is used for all persons. And to say the opposite, 
simply replace it with **no** (which is the word for _no_).

**ye si Sara.**
= She is Sarah.  
**ye no si Sara.**
= She is not Sarah.

**mau si zou.**
= The cat is an animal.  
**dom no si zou.**
= The house is not an animal.  

In the same way you can describe yourself by saying
**mi si**
and a word that describes you.

**mi si bon.**
= I'm good.  
**mi si man.**
= I'm a man.  
**mi si fem.**
= I'm a woman.  
**mi si nobi.**
= I'm non-binary.

## Saying hello

**salam**
= Hello!

This is how people often greet each other in Pandunia.
They say **salam**.
It is used for saying both hello and goodbye.

**salam**
= Bye!

The word
**salam**
means "greeting".
It is originally a Middle Eastern word for wishing well-being, health and safety.
It appears as "shlaam" in Aramaic, the language that Jesus of Nazareth spoke,
in Hebrew it is "shalom",
and in Arabic it is "salaam".
Today it is a common greeting in hundreds of languages in Africa, Asia and Europe.
Pandunia is a constructed world language
that borrows international words from all parts of the world.

The word **salam** is also a verb, which means "to greet".

**mi salam tu.**
= I greet you.  
**tu salam mi.**
= You greet me.

These are active sentences.
In active sentences the subject does the action to the object. In
**mi salam tu**
the first word,
**mi**,
is the subject,
**salam**
is the verb (action word), and
**tu**
is the object.
The order of subject, verb and object is the normal word order
in Pandunia.

> Word order in active sentence: Subject + Verb + Object

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, and
**ye** = he, she, it. Note that the pronouns stayed the same in the
previous example sentences. Words never change in Pandunia. They
always stay the same regardless of their position in sentence.

In Pandunia sentences can be made shorter by leaving out pronouns
that are obvious in the present situation.

**mi salam tu!**
= I greet you.  
**salam tu!**
= Greetings to you! (It is obvious that the speaker is the one who greets.)  
**salam!**
= Greeting! (It is obvious that the listeners are greeted.)  

Another Pandunia word for greeting is
**halo**.
It is also a very international greeting.
You can choose freely, which word to use when you greet people.

**halo!**
= Hello!

You may use both **salam** and **halo**
to address people by name, kinship term or profession.

**halo, toni!**
– Hello, Tony!  
**salam, mama!**
– Hello, mother!  
**halo, papa!**
– Hello, father!  
**salam, shefe!**
– Hello, chief!

## Making requests

### Dialog

<big>☻</big>
**halo!**
= Hello!  
<big>☺</big>
**halo! ching side.**
= Hello! Please sit!  
<big>☻</big>
**shukur.**
= Thank you.  
<big>☺</big>
**ching yam kafe o chai.**
= Please have some coffee or tea.  
<big>☻</big>
**mi vol chai. shukur.**
= I will have some tea, thank you.  
...  
<big>☺</big>
**ching salam tu su mama!**
= Please tell greetings to your mother.  
<big>☻</big>
**mi salam ye. salam reste!**
= I will. Bye!  
<big>☺</big>
**salam ga!**
= Bye!


### Grammar

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, and
**ye** = he, she, it. Pandunia is a gender-neutral language. It
doesn't distinguish between sexes in the third person pronoun or any
of the pronouns. All the personal pronouns are present in the
following example sentence.

**mi ching tu salam ye.**
= I ask you to say hello to him/her.

This sentence has a _pivot structure_.
The first verb,
**ching**
('to request), addresses
**tu**
as its object. At the same time
**tu**
serves also as the subject of the second verb,
**salam**
('to greet'), whose object is
**ye**.
So
**tu**
has a double role:
(1) object of the first verb and
(2) subject of the second verb.
Hence, it is the _pivot_ or hinge between the two verbs.

> Pivot Stucture: Subject + Verb¹ + Object/Subject + Verb² + Object

The pivot structure is a common structure in Pandunia.

Remember that it is allowed to leave out pronouns that are known in
the context. In other words the speaker can safely assume that the
listeners know who he or she is talking about. So it is unnecessary
to keep on repeating them. In this manner phrases can be made shorter.

**mi ching tu salam ye.**
= I ask you to say hello to him/her.  
**ching salam ye.**
= Please say hello to him/her.

See how the translation of
**ching**
changed between the two sentences?
The meaning of the word, the concept, did not change, but its use did.
English reflects this change by using different words, to ask and please.
Pandunia can cope with changes like this without resorting to different words.
It is a principle in Pandunia that there is always exactly one word for one concept.
Different words are not created just because the grammatical role of a concept changes.

The phrase
**ching salam ye**
has a useful pattern that can be used for making polite requests.

**ching side.**
= Please be seated.  
**ching don yo kafe.**
= Please give me some coffee.  
**ching don yo chai.**
= Please give me some tea.  
**ching yam yo chai.**
= Please have some tea.  
**ching safa la kamar.**
= Please clean the room.

Commands are introduced with
**amir**
('to command'). They employ the same pivot structure as requests with
**ching**.

**amir don yo chai.**
= Give (me) some tea!  
**amir safa la kamar.**
= Clean the room!

In practice, direct commands can be also made with just one verb and a commanding voice.

**safa ye!**
= Clean it!

## Yes or no questions

### Dialog

<big>☺</big>
**salam! sual tu yam kafe o chai?**
= Hello! Would you like to have coffee or tea?  
<big>☻</big>
**chai.**
= Tea.  
<big>☺</big>
**e tu?**
= And you?  
<big>☹</big>
**mi no basha pandunia...**
= I don't speak Pandunia...  
<big>☺</big>
**maf! sual ye yam chai?**
= Pardon! Will he have tea?  
<big>☻</big>
**no. ye no yam chai. ye yam kafe.**

<big>☺</big>
**sual tu yam supe?**

<big>☺</big>

### Asking questions

Questions that can be answered by saying _yes_ or _no_ have the same
pivot structure as requests with **ching**, which you learned in the
previous lesson. Question sentences are introduced with **sual** = to ask.

**mi sual tu yam chai.**
= I ask (do) you drink tea.  
**sual tu yam chai?**
= Do you drink tea?  
**sual yam chai?**
= Drink tea?

Requests usually concern the one or the ones spoken to, but questions
are often about other people. Therefore the second pronoun is usually
needed. It can be left out only when it is clear who is the topic of
discussion.

**sual ye yam chai?**
= Does he or she drink tea?  
**sual tu yam supe?**
= Do you eat soup?  
**sual mimon yam sui?**
= Do we drink water?

Of course common and proper nouns can also be used.

**sual shefe yam kafe?**
= Does the chief drink coffee?  
**sual papa safa kamar?**
= Does the father clean the room?  
**sual niki basha pandunia?**
= Does Nicky speak Pandunia?


### Giving answers

Yes/no questions can be answered with **ya** = yes, and **no** = no.

– **sual tu yam supe?**
= Do you eat soup?  
– **ya.**
= Yes.  
– **sual ye yam supe?**
= Does she eat soup?  
– **no.**
= No.

Also more complete answers can be given.

– **sual tu yam kafe?**
= Do you drink coffee?  
– **ya. mi yam kafe.**
= Yes, I drink coffee.  
– **sual ye yam kafe?**
= Does he drink coffee?  
– **no. ye no yam kafe.**
= No, he doesn't drink coffee.

It is also possible to answer yes by repeating the main verb of the question.

– **sual tu yam sui?**
= Do you drink water?  
– **yam.**
= (Yes, I) drink.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saying no

In the previous lesson you learned to answer **ya** and **no** to questions.
The word **no** is used for denying something.
Adding **no** in front of the verb turns an affirmative sentence to negative.

**mi salam tu.**
= I greet you.  
**mi no salam tu.**
= I do not greet you.

Conceptually negation means the absence or non-existence of the negated word.
In the phrase
**mi no salam tu**
the negative word **no** denies the existence of greeting.

In Pandunia the negative word affects the word that follows it.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location
of the negative word.

**mi ching tu safa la kamar.**
= I ask you to clean the room.  
**mi no ching tu safa la kamar.**
= I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**mi ching tu no safa la kamar.**
= I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The negated word can be of any type: verb, pronoun, noun, adjective
and even numeral.

**ye no ten mau.**
= She doesn't have a cat.  
**ye ten no mau, a vaf.**
= She has no cats but dogs.  
**no ye, a mi ten mau.**
= Not she but I have cats.  
**mi ten no un, a du mau.**
= I have not one but two cats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## More Questions

To ask questions beginning with _what_, _which_, _how_, _who_ and
_when_, the interrogative pronoun **ke** is normally used. The
question can be made more specific by adding words for person, time,
manner or thing if needed.

**ye si ke?**
= What is that? / Who is (s)he?  
**ye si ke jen?**
= Who is he/she?  
**ye si ke she?**
= What (thing) is it?  
**ke jen lai?**
= Who is coming? (**jen** = person)  
**tu yam na ke zaman?**
= When do you eat? (**zaman** = time)  
**mon danse na ke yang?**
= How to dance? (**yang** = manner, style)

In Pandunia, questions beginning with _why_ are asked using
**ke sabu**.

**ke sabu tu suka mau?**
= Why do you like cats?

Questions asking about the cause or reason of something, are answered
by adding **sabu** before the cause or reason. **sabu** is actually a
passive verb meaning _to be caused by_.

**ke sabu tu suka mau?**
= Why do you like cats?  
**ze sabu yemon si kavai.**
= Because they are cute.

Of course **sabu** can also be used to express the cause or reason for
something, even when not answering to a question.

**mi suka mau ze sabu yemon si kavai**
= I like cats because they are cute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Past, present and future

### Expressing time

There are no verb conjugations in Pandunia. All verbs have only one
form for all times. In a way they are similar to some English verbs,
such as "to hit", which is the same in all tenses.

**mi darba ye.**
= I hit it.

In Pandunia all verbs are like that! For example,
**mi yam pang**
can mean both "I eat bread" and "I ate bread",
but usually only one or the other meaning makes sense in the context of the discussion.
For example when people talk about that morning's breakfast, the sentence tells about the past time.

**mi yam pang na ni suba yam.**
= I ate bread for this breakfast.

There are also specific time words.

**zai**
= currently, at the moment  
**sha**
= later, in the future

They can be used for modifying nouns.

**Sara si mi su pas shefe.**
= Sarah is my former boss.  
**Yusef si mi su zai shefe.**
= Yusef is my current boss.  
**Maria si mi su sha shefe.**
= Maria is my future boss.

The same words are used when you talk about actions and events in time.
Simply put the word before the verb.

**mi pas darba ye.**
= I hit it (in the past).  
**mi zai darba ye.**
= I am hitting it (currently).  
**mi sha darba ye.**
= I will hit it (in the future).

It's also possible to use preposition phrases of time.

**mi darba ye na pas.**
= I hit it in the past.  
**mi darba ye na zai.**
= I hit it at present.  
**mi darba ye na sha.**
= I hit it in the future.


It is not necessary to repeat the time expressions all the time.
It would be awkward.
It is enough to set the stage once in the beginning with a time expression.
Another time word will not be needed until the tense changes
or until it becomes useful to stress that you are still talking in the same tense.

**mi pas ten un mau.**
= I had a cat in the past.  
**ye si bon mau.**
= It was a good cat.  
**mi ten un vaf na zai.**
= I have a dog now.

Any expression of time is good for expressing the tense. When one
time expression is present, other markers are not needed.

**mi be jene na nen 2003.**
= I was born in 2003.  
**ye safa la kamar na pos den.**
= He will clean the room tomorrow.
