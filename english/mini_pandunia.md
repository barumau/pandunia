# The basic rules of Mini Pandunia

These are the basic rules of Mini Pandunia language.
They are described in more detail later in this document.

1. **World words:**
   Pandunia is an evenly global language.
   International words are borrowed from all parts of the world to Pandunia.
   They are adapted to the pronunciation and orthography of Pandunia.
   One base word is admitted and additional words are built from it according to rule 10.
2. **Spelling and pronunciation:**
   Spelling is simple and regular.
   Every word is pronounced exactly as it is written.
   Almost every letter and letter-combination indicates always the same sound.
3. **Regular accent:**
   If the word has one or two syllables, the first syllable is accented.
   If the word has three or more syllables, the second syllable is accented.
4. **Pronouns:**
    - The personal pronouns are:
     **mi** _I_, **tu** _you_ (sg.), **ye** _he or she_,
     **mimon** _we_, **tumon** _you_ (pl.), **yemon** _they_.
    - The possessive pronouns are:
      **mi su** _my_, **tu su** _your_, **ye su** _his or her_,
      **mimon su** _our_, **tumon su** _your_, **yemon su** _their_.
     - The interrogative pronouns are: **ke** _what_ or _who_, **ke su** _whose_.
     - The impersonal pronoun is
       **mon**
       (_one_, _you_, _they_)
5. **Nouns:**
   Nouns have only one form, always the same.
   Their form is not affected by number, gender or case.
   Number is indicated by number and quantity words.
   Their role is indicated by word order or by a preposition.
6. **Numerals:**
   The cardinal numbers are:
       - 0 **siro**, 1 **un**, 2 **du**, 3 **tri**, 4 **nelu**, 5 **lima**, 6 **luka**,
         7 **cheti**, 8 **bati**, 9 **tisa**, 10 **des**.
       - Greater than ten: 11 **des un**, 12 **des du**, 13 **des tri**, etc.
       - Tens: 20 **du des**, 30 **tri des**, 40 **nelu des**, etc.
       - Hundreds: 100 **un sento**, 200 **du sento**, 300 **tri sento**, etc.
       - Thousands: 1000 **un kilo**, 2000 **du kilo**, 3000 **tri kilo**, etc.
       - The ordinal numbers use the suffix **me**: **un me** (first), **du me** (second), **tri me** (third), etc.
7. **Modifiers:**
   The adjective and the adverb have the same form.
   The adjective modifier is before the noun that it modifies,
   and the adverb modifier is before the verb that it modifies.
    - **un rapide loga**
      – A fast speech.
    - **tu rapide loga.**
      – You speak fast.
8. **Verbs:**
   The verb does not change in person, number and tense.
   Auxiliary verbs indicate time.
    - **zai** indicates an ongoing event.
    - **le** indicates a completed event whose results have an effect on the present situation.
    - **pas** indicates a completed event that has no connection to the present situation.
    - **sha** indicates a future event.
9. **Word order:**
    - The word order is subject–verb–object.
      The same order is used in declarations and questions.
    - A passive sentence is created with the help of the passive auxiliary verb **be**.
      A similar effect can be also reached with the impersonal pronoun **mon**.
        - **pandunia be loga.**
          – Pandunia is spoken.
        - **mon loga la pandunia.**
          – One speaks Pandunia.
    - In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb
      functions as the subject of the following verb.
        - **mi ching tu loga la pandunia.**
          – I ask you to speak Pandunia.
    - Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
        - **_mi_ ching _tu_ loga la pandunia.**
          → **ching loga la pandunia.**
          – Please speak Pandunia.
10. **Word building:**
   In Mini Pandunia, words change only when their actual meaning changes.
   Words don't ever change only to serve in a different grammatical role.
   Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them.
   The main word stands at the end.
    - **posta**
      ("mail") +
      **kasa**
      ("box") =
      **posta kasa**
      ("mailbox")

# Pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

## Personal pronouns

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi**      | **mimon**    |
| I, me       | we           |
| **tu**      | **tumon**    |
| you         | you all      |
| **ye**      | **yemon**    |
| he or she   | they         |

All pronouns can be used for all genders.

The possessive pronouns consists of the personal pronoun and the possessive particle
**su**.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi su**   | **mimon su** |
| my          | our          |
| **tu su**   | **tumon su** |
| your        | your         |
| **ye su**   | **yemon su** |
| his or her  | their        |


## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**se**
– self

Note! The same reflexive pronoun is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi vide se**
– I see myself.  
**ye vide se**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mimon vide se.**
– We see ourselves.

The expression **semon** is used as the reciprocal pronoun.

**semon**
– each other, one another

**mi e tu vide semon.**
– Me and you see each other.  
**mimon vide semon.**
– We see each other.


## Demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used with nouns to make them more specific.
The demonstrative pronouns in Mini Pandunia are:

**ni**
– this (near the speaker)  
**go**
– that (far from speaker)  
**la**
– the (known by both the speaker and the listener)

In Mini Pandunia, **ni**, **go** and **la** work only as modifiers
and they always require a noun after them.
To use them like pronouns, a generic noun like
**she**
('thing') needs to be added after these words.

The proximal demonstrative
**ni**
points to things that are near the speaker.
The distal demonstrative
**go**
points to things that are far from the speaker.

**ni she si bon.**
– This (thing) is good.  
**go she si dus.**
– That (thing) is bad.  
**mi vol ni buku, no go.**
– I want this book, not that.

The basic proximal and distal pronouns are used for introducing a new object.
The topical demonstrative **la**, on the other hand,
does not specify physical distance
but it is used when the speaker has already mentioned the object or person in question
and it is known by the audience or is topical within the discourse.

**ni she si mau. ye vol yam go mushu.**
– This is a cat. It wants to eat that mouse.

**mi ten un mau e un vaf. la vaf si dai. ye yam poli yam.**
– I have a cat and a dog. The dog is big. It eats a lot of food.


### Abstract use

The demonstrative pronouns can be used also discourse internally.
Then they refer to abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects.
**la** refers to things previously spoken,
**ni** refers to things currently being spoken,
and **go** refers to things about to be spoken.

**ni jumle si korte.**
– This sentence is short.

In the above, **ni jumle** (_this sentence_) refers to the sentence being spoken.

**mi mana go: mi ama tu.**
– I mean this: I love you. OR I mean that I love you.  
**mi ama tu. mi mana la.**
– I love you. That is what I mean.

In the above, the pronoun **go** refers to the content of the next statement
and **la** refers to the content of the previous statement.


## Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is also **ke**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ke she?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ke jen?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ke zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  
**ke yang?** 
– How? (What way?)  
**ke sabu?**
– Why? (What reason?)

Also adjectives are questioned with **ke**.

**ke nove?**
– How new?  
**ke koste?**
– How costy?  
**ke poli?**
– How many?  
**ke dai?**
– How big?  
**ke lili?**
– How small?

**tu ten ke dai di mau?**
– How big a cat do you have?


## Nouns

### Only one form

A noun is a word that names a thing.
Like all words in Mini Pandunia, nouns don't ever change their form.
So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

**seku**
– a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
**meza**
– a table, tables, the table or the tables  
**kursi**
– a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
**sui**
– water

Number and definiteness are often known because they were previously mentioned in the conversation or because they are general knowledge.
For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **luna** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and moon.


### Indicating number

Pandunia nouns have the same form
in singular (when there is one)
and plural (when there is more than one).
Therefore all Pandunia nouns are like English words
_sheep_, _deer_ and _fish_,
which also have only one form.

A numeral or another quantity word can be added to indicate number
– but usually it's not necessary.
Simply insert a numeral in front of the unchanged noun.

**meme**
– (one or more) sheep  
**un meme**
– a sheep or one sheep  
**du meme**
– two sheep  
**tri meme**
– three sheep  
**ba meme**
– many sheep

**kursi**
– a chair or chairs  
**un kursi**
– one chair  
**du kursi**
– two chairs  
**tri kursi**
– three chairs  
**ba kursi**
– many chairs

An easy way to say that there are many is to repeat the noun two times.

**seku seku**
– stones and stones, a variety of stones  
**buku buku**
– books and books, a variety of books


### Proper names

Proper names are nouns for individual people, places and other things.

Names of people can be tagged with the universal title of respect
**shi**.
Using it shows respect and politeness.

It can be used in formal and informal situations and for all age groups, social groups and genders.
The closest translation for it in English is _Mr or Ms_ or _Mx_.

There are different customs concerning honorific titles in different cultures.
In some cultures it is not polite to use someone's name without a title of respect.
Therefore it is advisable to use **shi** always when you meet new people from different cultures.

A title of respect can be used with a given name, a family name, or both.

**shi Bili King**
– Mx Billy King  
**shi Bili**
– Mx Billy  
**shi King**
– Mx King


### Compound words

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word.
The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound,
and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

**sol foto**
– sun light  
**luna foto**
– moon light  
**luna seku**
– moon stone

# Numerals

## Cardinal numbers

| Ones    | Ten and over | 20 and over      | 30 and over      |
|:--------|:-------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| 0 siro  | 10 (un) des  | 20 du des        | 30 tri des       |
| 1 un    | 11 des un    | 21 du des un     | 31 tri des un    |
| 2 du    | 12 des du    | 22 du des du     | 32 tri des du    |
| 3 tri   | 13 des tri   | 23 du des tri    | 33 tri des tri   |
| 4 nelu  | 14 des nelu  | 24 du des nelu   | 34 tri des nelu  |
| 5 lima  | 15 des lima  | 25 du des lima   | 35 tri des lima  |
| 6 luka  | 16 des luka  | 26 du des luka   | 36 tri des luka  |
| 7 cheti | 17 des cheti | 27 du des cheti  | 37 tri des cheti |
| 8 bati  | 18 des bati  | 28 du des bati   | 38 tri des bati  |
| 9 tisa  | 19 des tisa  | 29 du des tisa   | 39 tri des tisa  |

| Ones    |  Tens         | Hundreds        | Thousands        |
|:--------|:-------------|:----------------|:------------------|
| 1 un    | 10 (un) des  | 100 (un) sento  | 1000 (un) kilo    |
| 2 du    | 20 du des    | 200 du sento    | 2000 du kilo      |
| 3 tri   | 30 tri des   | 300 tri sento   | 3000 tri kilo     |
| 4 nelu  | 40 nelu   des| 400 nelu sento  | 4000 nelu kilo    |
| 5 lima  | 50 lima  des | 500 lima sento  | 5000 lima kilo    |
| 6 luka  | 60 luka des  | 600 luka sento  | 6000 luka kilo    |
| 7 cheti | 70 cheti des | 700 cheti sento | 7000 cheti kilo   |
| 8 bati  | 80 bati des  | 800 bati sento  | 8000 bati kilo    |
| 9 tisa  | 90 tisa des  | 900 tisa sento  | 9000 tisa kilo    |

Greater numbers follow the same logic as above.

10'000 = un des kilo  
100'000 = un sento kilo  
1'000'000 = un mega  
10'000'000 = un des mega  
100'000'000 = un sento mega  
1'000'000'000 = un giga

The numerals that are greater than one hundred are borrowed from the
[International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) (SI).
They are used in scientific words in the whole world.

| Prefix | Symbol | Base 10 | Decimal                        |
|:-------|:------:|:-----|----------------------------------:|
| kilo   | k      | 10³  |                             1'000 |
| mega   | M      | 10⁶  |                         1'000'000 |
| giga   | G      | 10⁹  |                     1'000'000'000 |
| tera   | T      | 10¹² |                 1'000'000'000'000 |
| peta   | P      | 10¹⁵ |             1'000'000'000'000'000 |
| eksa   | E      | 10¹⁸ |         1'000'000'000'000'000'000 |
| zeta   | Z      | 10²¹ |     1'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 |
| yota   | Y      | 10²⁴ | 1'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 |


### Cardinal number before noun

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words.
They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

**un sing**
– one star  
**du sing**
– two stars  
**tri sing**
– three stars  
**shau sing**
– few stars  
**poli sing**
– many stars

**un dai kursi**
– one big chair  
**du dai kursi**
– two big chairs  
**tri bon kursi**
– three good chairs


## Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers are created with the particle **me**.

- **un me**
  – first
- **du me**
  – second
- **tri me**
  – third
- **nelu me**
  – fourth
- **lima me**
  – fifth
- **luka me**
  – sixth
- **cheti me**
  – seventh
- **bati me**
  – eighth
- **tisa me**
  – ninth
- **des me**
  – tenth

They are placed before the modified noun like normal adjectives.

**un me fen**
– the first part  
**du me fen**
– the second part  
**tri me fen**
– the third part

### Ordinal number after noun

Another way to form ordinal numbers is to place the number after the noun.

**fen un**
– the first part (part one)
**fen du**
– the second part (part two)
**fen tri**
– the third part (part three)


## Fractions

There are two ways to create fractions.
Both of them use the word
**fen**
('part').

The short way is to use ordinal numbers.

**un fen du**
– a half (½)  
**un fen nelu**
– one fourth, one quarter (¼)  
**tri fen nelu**
– three fourths, three quarters (¾)  
**un fen sento**
– one hundredth, one percent (1%)  
**un fen kilo**
– one thousandth, one permille (1‰)

The longer way uses the pattern
**X da Y fen**
('X of Y parts').

**un da du fen**
– one of two parts, a half (½)  
**un da nelu fen**
– one of four parts, a quarter (¼)  
**tri da nelu fen**
– three of four parts, three quarters (¾)  
**un da sento fen**
– one of hundred parts, a percent, (1%)  
**un da kilo fen**
– one of thousand parts, a permille, (1‰)

Fractions are connected to the noun with
**da**
('of').

**un fen du da hor**
– a half (of an) hour  
**lima des fen sento da jen**
– fifty percent of people  
**du fen tri da keke**
– two thirds of a cake  


## Date and time

#### Days of the week

Days of the week include the word
**var**
('day of the week').
They are numbered starting from Monday.
Monday is
**var un**
('weekday one'),
Tuesday is
**var du**
('weekday two')
and so on.

1. **var un**
   – Monday
2. **var du**
   – Tuesday
3. **var tri**
   – Wednesday
4. **var nelu**
   – Thursday
5. **var lima**
   – Friday
6. **var luka**
   – Saturday
7. **var cheti**
   – Sunday

#### Months

Names of the months are composed like the names of days
but this time the word
**mes**
('month') is used.

1. **mes un**
   – January
2. **mes du**
   – February
3. **mes tri**
   – March
4. **mes nelu**
  – April
5. **mes lima**
  – May
6. **mes luka**
  – June
7. **mes cheti**
  – July
8. **mes bati**
  – August
9. **mes tisa**
  – September
10. **mes des**
  – October
11. **mes des un**
  – November
12. **mes des du**
  – December

#### Telling time

Time can be told with the word
**hor**
('hour').
The 24 hour clock is the standard.

**hor des du**
– twelve o'clock  
**hor des du e tri des**
– twelve thirty, half past twelve  
**hor du des**
– eight PM  
**hor du des e des lima**
– quarter past eight PM


# Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality or description,
such as good, bad, big, and fast, to another word.
In Mini Pandunia, there is only one class of modifiers.
The same word can modify both nouns and verbs,
whereas in English only _adjectives_ can modify nouns
and only _adverbs_ can modify verbs.
For example, the word
**sundar**
('beautiful' or 'beautifully')
modifies a noun in sentence A
and a verb in sentence B.

A. **go si un _sundar_ kitabu.**
– That is a beautiful writing.  
B. **tu _sundar_ di kitabu.**
– You write _beautifully_.


### Modifying nouns

In Mini Pandunia, "adjectives" are modifiers that are placed before the noun that they modify.

**un _nove_ kar**
– a _new_ car  
**un _rapide_ kar**
– a _fast_ car  
**ba _dai_ meza**
– _big_ tables  
**ba _gau_ meza**
– high tables  
**un bon jen**
– a good person

Two or more modifiers can modify the same noun.

**un lili nove kar**
– a little new car


### Modifying verbs

A modifier that modifies a verb
is placed immediately before the verb.

**tu _rapide_ loga.**
– You talk _fast_.  
**yemon _bon_ kitabu.**
– They write _well_.

It is common to put the modifying particle
**di**
between the modifier and the verb.
It makes the structure of the verb phrase clearer.

**tu _sundar di_ kitabu.**
– You write _beautifully_.  
**yemon _rapide di_ marche.**
– They walk _fast_.


### Modifying other modifiers

The particle
**di**
is used also when a modifier modifies another one.

**un _surpris di_ bon buku**
– a _surprisingly_ good book  
**ba _lika di_ ama ja jen**
– _strongly_ loving people


#### Degree words

Degree words tell us about the intensity of something.

**tre**
– very  
**bas**
– quite, sufficiently, enough  
**mas**
– more  
**min**
– less
**mas ka bas**
– too  

Degree words are placed before the word that they modify.

**un dai man**
– a big man  
**un tre dai man**
– a very big man  
**un bas dai man**
– a big enough man / a sufficiently big man
**un mas dai man ka bas**
– a too big man  

A degree word together with a modifier forms a _compound adverb_
that can modify a verb or a sentence.
The compound adverb is placed immediately before the verb that it modifies.

**tre poli**
– very much  
**mi _tre poli_ vol loga.**
– I want very much to speak.  
**mi vol _tre poli_ loga.**
– I want to speak very much.

It is also possible to place the compound adverb very last in the sentence,
and then it modifies the sentence as a whole.
The meaning is the same like when the compound adverb modifies the main verb.

**mi vol loga _tre poli_.**
– I want to speak very much.  
**sual tu sona _bas bon_?**
– Did you sleep well enough?


### Adverbs of comparison

Adjectives can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- **mas**
  (_more_) indicates comparison of superiority
- **masim**
  (_most_) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim**
  (_least_) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **par**
  (_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**ka**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple si mas bon ka oranje.**
= Apples are better than oranges.  
**oranje si min bon ka aple.**
= Oranges are less good than apples.  
**tu loga par bon ka mi.**
= You speak as well as me.

# Verbs

Verbs are unchanging in Pandunia.
Things like person, number, time and mood are indicated by separate words,
not by changing the form of verbs as in English and other languages.

## Person and number

Person and number are indicated by the subject.
For example, the verb
**si**
('to be') has the same form for all persons.

**_mi_ si dosti.**
– I am a friend.  
**_tu_ si dosti.**
– You are a friend.  
**_ye_ si dosti.**
– He or she is a friend.  
**_mimon_ si dosti.**
– We are friends.  
**_tumon_ si dosti.**
– You are friends.  
**_yemon_ si dosti.**
– They are friends.

Also a noun can serve as subject.

**mau si zou.**
– The cat is an animal.

Frequently there is a marker between the subject and the verb
to indicate where the subject ends and the verb begins.
It is particularly helpful when the subject and the verb are content words
that could serve as both.
The marker is typically a particle or an auxiliary verb.
One of the many suitable markers is
**ya**
('yes'),
which adds no content to the sentence
but helps to clarify its structure.

**peshe si mau yam.**
– Fish is catfood.  
**mau _ya_ yam yo peshe.**
– The cat eats some fish.

Other suitable markers include auxiliaries of time and mood,
which are introduced next.


## Auxiliaries of time

The relationship of an action, event or state to time is indicated with auxiliary verbs.

**shuru**
('begin, start')
indicates beginning of an action or transition to a new situation.

**mi shuru fuku la kote.**
– I start wearing the coat. = I put the coat on.  
**kaguji ya shuru hogo.**
– Paper starts to burn.  
**tu shuru yam.**
– You start to eat.

**fin**
('end, cease, quit, stop')
conveys the idea of "to stop doing something".

**yemon fin haha.**
– They stopped laughing.  
**kaguji ya fin hoge.**
– Paper ceased to burn.  
**tu fin yam.**
– You stop eating.

**pul**
('fulfill', 'complete')
indicates that an action is done completely.

**tu pul yam un piza.**
– You ate a pizza completely.  
**mi pul vide la filme.**
– I completed watching the film. / I watched the film completely.

**fen**
('partially')
indicates that the action is only partially done.

**tu fen yam un piza.**

# Sentences

## Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type.
They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention.

**mau!**
– A cat!  
**shava!**
– (It) rains!

## Stative Sentences

### With noun or pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate.
In the simplest sentences, the subject is a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

**mi bon.**
– I am good.  
**ye nove.**
– It is new.  
**ye Sara.**
– She is Sara.

When the subject is a noun, the connecting verb **si** (_to be_) is necessary.


**Sara si bon.**
– Sara is good.  
**seku si dai.**
– Stones are big.  
**meza si nove.**
– The table is new.

The word **no** is added to form the negative.
Then the verb **si** is not needed.

| Positive         | Negative           |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **mi bon.**      | **mi no bon.**     |
| I am good.       | I am not good.     |
| **ye nove.**     | **ye no nove.**    |
| It is new.       | It is not new.     |
| **ye Sara.**     | **ye no Sara.**    |
| She is Sarah.    | She is not Sarah.  |
| **Sara si bon.** | **Sara no bon.**   |
| Sarah is good.   | Sarah is not good. |


Also two personal pronouns can be combined with **si** and **no**.

**mi si ye.**
– I am he/she.  
**mi no tu.**
– I'm not you.


### With adjective or verb subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives, or a verb and an adjective.

**jovan si sundar.**
– Young is beautiful.  
**nove no lau.**
– New is not old.  
**chanta si bon.**
– Singing is good.


## Action Sentences

A predicate can also be a verb. In this case, there may be objects as well as the subject.
These come after the predicate.

**mi marche.**
– I walk.  
**tu yam yo apel.**
– You eat some apples.  
**mimon dona ye yo pesa.**
– We give her some money.

Sometimes, the subjet of one sentence can become the object of another.

**la fuku ya gan.**
– The clothes dry.  
**la sol ya gan la fuku.**
– The sun dries the clothes.

To clarify the order or to add other objects, the auxiliary verbs **fa** and **be** are used.
**fa** indicates that the subject is the agent or doer of the action,
and **be** indicates that the subject is the patient, or receiver.

**mi fa salam mi su dosti.**
– I greet my friend.  
**mi be salam mi su dosti.**
– I am greeted by my friend.  
**pa fa mi salam mi su dosti.**
– Father makes me greet my friend.


## Pivot structure

### Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  
subject – verb 1 – object 1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 has two roles.
It is at the same time the object for the verb 1 and the subject for the verb 2.

**mi vol tu yam ba fito.**
– I want you to eat vegetables.

In the example above,
**mi vol**
has
**tu**
as its object.
At the same time,
**tu**
functions as the subject of the following predicate,
**yam ba fito**.
So
**tu**
is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.

The second verb in a pivot structure is the main verb.
The first verb is a modal verb,
which indicates a modality such as desire, permission or obligation.

**mi vol tu yam ba fito.**
– I want you to eat vegetables. (desire)  
**mi sel tu yam ba fito.**
– I advise you to eat vegetables. (advice)  
**mi halal tu yam ba fito.**
– I allow you to eat vegetables. (permission)  
**mi bil tu yam ba fito.**
– I enable you to eat vegetables. (ability)  
**mi mus tu yam ba fito.**
– I compel you to eat vegetables. (obligation)  
**mi rai tu yam ba fito.**
– I think you eat vegetables. (opinion)


## Verb series structure

There can be two, three or even more verbs in a series,
and all of them are about the same subject.
 
1. **mi ga do dom.**
   – I go home.  
2. **mi bil ga do dom.**
   – I can go home.  
3. **mi vol bil ga do dom.**
   – I want to be able to go home.
   (Word for word: _I want can go home_!)

The last verb in the series is the main verb.
The verbs before it are modal verbs.

**tu vol yam yo fito.**
– You want to eat vegetables. (desire)  
**tu sel yam yo fito.**
– You had better eat vegetables. (advice)  
**tu halal yam yo fito.**
– You may eat vegetables. (permission)  
**tu bil yam yo fito.**
– You can eat vegetables. (ability)  
**tu mus yam yo fito.**
– You must eat vegetables. (obligation)

## Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity.
This is done especially in commands and requests.

### Short pivot structure (VOVO)

**mi amir tu kai la mun.**
– I command you to open the door.  
**amir tu kai la mun.**
– Open the door!

### Short pivot structure (VVO)

**mi ching tu lai do dom.**
– I ask you to come home.  
**ching lai do dom!**
– Please come home!
(Word for word: _Request come home!_)


## Questions

### Yes-no questions

_Yes-no_ questions are questions that expect 'yes' or 'no' as answer.
The easiest way to form a yes-no question in Pandunia is to simply attach the particle
**he**
('eh', 'huh') to the end of a statement.

**tu yam un piza.**
– You eat a pizza. (statement)  
**tu yam un piza, he?**
– Do you eat a pizza? (question)

It is also possible to use
**no**
('no', 'not') or
**ya**
('yes') instead of
**he**
to suggest the expected answer.

**tu yam un piza, no?**
– You eat a pizza, don't you?  
**tu yam un piza, ya?**
– You eat a pizza, right?

The third way to ask a yes-no question is to contradict the verb
with the _A-not-A_ structure.

**tu yam no yam un piza?**
– Do you or don't you eat a pizza?  
**tu bil no bil yam un piza?**
– Can you or can't you eat a pizza?

Finally, you can emphasize the question by using **sual**.

**mi sual, tu yam un piza?**
– I ask do you eat a pizza?  
**sual tu yam un piza?**
– Do you eat a pizza?

Yes-no questions are answered with
**ya**
('yes') and
**no**
('no').

**tu vide mi, he?**
– Do you see me?  
**ya. (mi ya vide tu.)**
– Yes. (I _do_ see you.)  
**no. (mi no vide tu.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)

Negative questions are answered so that
**ya**
and
**no**
apply to the verb, not the whole question.

**tu no vide mi, he?**
– Don't you see me?  
**ya. (mi vide tu.)**
– Yes. (I see you.)  
**no. (mi no vide tu.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)


### Alternative questions

Questions that offer alternatives end with the particle
**he**
or start with the word
**sual**
to indicate that an answer is expected.
The question is answered by repeating the chosen alternative.

**tu yam un o du banana.**
– You eat one or two bananas. (statement)  
**tu yam un o du banana, he?**
– Do you eat one or two bananas? (question)  
**un.**
– One.


## Open questions

Open questions, or _wh-_ questions, ask for more information.
In Pandunia they use the word **ke**.

**piza si ke?**
– What is pizza?

The question word may be moved to the front of the sentence for emphasis.
However, unlike in English, the word order may also be left alone.

**ke she tu zai yam?**
– What are you eating?  
**tu zai yam ke she?**
– You are eating what?  
**ye lai na ke sata?**
– When does he arrive?  
**tumon keka na ke jen su dom?**
– Whose house did you all visit?


## Relative clauses

A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun phrase, most commonly a noun.
For example, the phrase "the person who lives there" containst the noun _person_,
which is modified by the relative clause _who lives there_.

There are different ways to build a relative clause in Pandunia.
The relative pronoun in Pandunia is **jo**
and it corresponds to English _that_, _who_ and _which_.

In Pandunia, relative clauses are always set off by commas.

**la buku, jo la jen fa kitabu, pade.**
– The book, which the person writes, falls.

It is possible to leave also **jo** out.
This structure is called _reduced relative clause_.

**la buku, la jen fa kitabu, pade.**
– The book the person writes falls.

The relative pronoun is necessary
when the relativized noun is the subject of the relative clause.

**la jen, jo fa kitabu la buku, pade.**
– The person that writes the book falls.

Also the object noun of a preposition can be the target of the relative clause.
It's possible to use relative pronouns or the reduced relative clause structure.

**la kalam, na jo la jen fa kitabu la buku, pade.**
– The pen, with _which_ the person writes the book, falls.  
**la kalam, la jen fa kitabu la buku na, pade.**
– The pen the person writes the book with falls.

The relative pronoun can be put in its right place in the pivot structure
or it can be left out by using the reduced relative clause structure.

**la jen, mi vide jo fa kitabu la buku, pade.**
– The person, whom I see write the book, falls.  
**la jen, mi vide fa kitabu la buku, pade.**
– The person that I see write the book falls.  

Also _resumptive relative pronoun_ can be used if needed.

**la jen, mi fa kitabu la buku na jo su kalam, padu.**
– The person whose pen I write the book with falls.


## Content clauses

A content clause is a subordinate clause that provides content that is commented or referred to by its main clause.
In Pandunia they are typically introduced with the conjunction
**ki**.

**mi sabe ki tu si dosti.**
– I know that you are a friend.  
**yemon fikir ki mimon le chuti.**
– They think that we have left.

A content clause can be placed before or after the clause that talks about it.
The demonstrative
**go**
points to the following content clause and
**la**
points to the previous one.

**go si bari, ki mi le no vide yemon.**
– _It_ is important _that I haven't seen them_.  
**ki pan jen be sana ka par, la si klar.**
– _That all people are created as equals_; _it_ is clear.

The content clause marker
**ki**
can be combined to the prepositions in order to construct conjunctions of cause and purpose.

**do ki**
– so that, in order that, with the result that  
**ze ki**
– because, for the reason that

**mi duku ni buku _do ki_ mi transe la teste.**
– I read this book so that I will pass the test.  
**mi le transe la teste _ze ki_ mi duku la buku.**
– I have passed the test because I read the book.


## Conditional clauses

The word **gar** means 'to suppose',
and in conditional sentences, it works in the same way as English 'if'.

**mi no yam ye gar mi si tu.**
– I wouldn't eat it _if_ I were you.

The rest of the sentence can optionally be preceded by the word **asar**, which means 'then'.

**gar tu tochu la tava, asar tu pasi la hande.**
– _If_ you touch the pan, _then_ you will hurt your hand.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Combining phrases with conjunctions

**e**
– and (connects two similar words or phrases)  
**o**
– or (connects two alternative words or phrases)  
**a**
– but (introduces a word or phrase that contrasts with or contradicts the preceding word or phrase)

**mi suka mau e vaf.**
– I like cats and dogs.  
**mi suka mau o vaf.**
– I like cats or dogs.  
**mi suka mau a no vaf.**
– I like cats but not dogs.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Particles

### Affirmation and Negation

#### Affirmative

Expressions are affirmative by default.

**mi si shefe.**
– I am the boss.  
**ye si nove meza.**
– It is a new table.

Affirmation can be emphasized with the adverb
**ya**
('yes indeed').

**mi ya si shefe.**
– I indeed am the boss.  
**ye ya si nove meza.**
– It indeed is a new table.

#### Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

**ye no si shefe.**
– He is not the boss.  
**ye no si nove meza.**
– It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything.
It affects always the next word.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location of the negative word.

**mi vide tu.**
– I see you.  
**mi no vide tu.**
– I don't see you.  
**mi vide no tu a yemon.**
– I see, not you, but them.

**mi ching tu safa la kamar.**
– I ask you to clean the room.  
**mi no ching tu safa la kamar.**
– I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**mi ching tu no safa la kamar.**
– I ask you NOT to clean the room.


### Modifier particles

Particles **di** and **da** are used to link a noun, an adjective or a verb phrase to a noun to modify it.
**di** connects the modifying word or phrase to the main noun word.
**da** works in the opposite direction, it connects the main noun to the modifying word or phrase.

#### Modification with noun phrases

One way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun.
It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

**rode rang di labi**
– rose-colored lips  
**sama rang di yen**
– sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

**labi da rode rang**
– lips of the rose-color  
**yen da sama rang**
– eyes of the sky-color

The particles help in creating measure words too.
 
**un sake di patate**
– one sack of potatoes  
**du sake di patate**
– two sacks of potatoes  
**mas sake di patate**
– more sacks of potatoes

Note that **di** and **da** connect phrases together.
So a modifier phrase with and without **da** can mean a different thing.

**mas sundar hua**
– more beautiful flowers  
**mas di sundar hua**
– more of beautiful flowers

#### Modification with verb phrases

Verbs are turned into modifiers by placing **da** or **di** immediately next to the verb.
Verb phrases can also be made into modifiers in this way, but any objects must be moved to before the verb.

**suta da grafi pente**
– the art of picture-painting (the art of painting pictures)  
**alo su mede su suka**
– the joy of others-helping (the joy of helping others)

#### Possession

The possessive particle
**su**
works like the apostrophe-s ('s) in English.
It indicates that the previous word has possession of the next one.

**Maria su mama**
– Maria's mother  
**Maria su mama su dom**
– Maria's mother's house

The same particle is used with with personal pronouns too.

**mi su dom**
– my house  
**tu su dom**
– your house  
**ye su dom**
– his or her house  
**mimon su dom**
– our house  
**tumon su dom**
– your house  
**yemon su dom**
– their house


### Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed.
The general time words are **pas** (past), **zai** (present) and **sha** (future, upcoming).
They function like adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb.

**mi pas ha mau.**
– I had cats.  
**a mi no zai ha mau.**
– But I now don't have cats.  
**bil, mi sha ha mau.**
– Maybe I will have cats.

It's also possible to say it in a longer way like **na pas zaman** (in the past) etc.

**mi ha mau na pas zaman.**
– I had cats in the past.  
**a mi no ha mau na zai zaman.**
– But I don't have cats at present.  
**bil, mi ha mau na sha zaman.**
– Maybe I will have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated.
So the verb **ha** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary.
Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text
and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.
