# Sentences

## Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type.
They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention.

**mau!**
– A cat!  
**shava!**
– (It) rains!

## Stative Sentences

### With noun or pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate.
In the simplest sentences, the subject is a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

**me bon.**
– I am good.  
**le novi.**
– It is new.  
**le Sara.**
– She is Sara.

When the subject is a noun, the connecting verb **sa** (_to be_) is necessary.


**Sara sa bon.**
– Sara is good.  
**seku sa dai.**
– Stones are big.  
**meza sa novi.**
– The table is new.

The word **no** is added to form the negative.
Then the verb **sa** is not needed.

| Positive          | Negative           |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| **me (sa) bon.**  | **me no bon.**     |
| I am good.        | I am not good.     |
| **le (sa) novi.** | **le no novi.**    |
| It is new.        | It is not new.     |
| **le (sa) Sara.** | **le no Sara.**    |
| She is Sarah.     | She is not Sarah.  |
| **Sara sa bon.**  | **Sara no bon.**   |
| Sarah is good.    | Sarah is not good. |


Also two personal pronouns can be combined with **sa** and **no**.

**me sa le.**
– I am he/she.  
**me no te.**
– I'm not you.


### With adjective or verb subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives, or a verb and an adjective.

**jun sa mei.**
– Young is beautiful.  
**novi no lau.**
– New is not old.  
**chanta sa bon.**
– Singing is good.


## Action Sentences

A predicate can also be a verb. In this case, there may be objects as well as the subject.
These come after the predicate.

**me marche.**
– I walk.  
**te jam yo apel.**
– You eat some apples.  
**mes dona le yo pesa.**
– We give her some money.

Sometimes, the subjet of one sentence can become the object of another.

**la fuku jo gan.**
– The clothes dry.  
**la sol jo gan la fuku.**
– The sun dries the clothes.

To clarify the order or to add other objects, the auxiliary verbs **fa** and **be** are used.
**fa** indicates that the subject is the agent or doer of the action,
and **be** indicates that the subject is the patient, or receiver.

**me fa salam mi doste.**
– I greet my friend.  
**me be salam mi doste.**
– I am greeted by my friend.  
**pa fa me salam mi doste.**
– Father makes me greet my friend.


## Pivot structure

### Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  
subject – verb 1 – object 1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 has two roles.
It is at the same time the object for the verb 1 and the subject for the verb 2.

**me vol te jam ba fito.**
– I want you to eat vegetables.

In the example above,
**me vol**
has
**te**
as its object.
At the same time,
**te**
functions as the subject of the following predicate,
**jam ba fito**.
So
**te**
is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.

The second verb in a pivot structure is the main verb.
The first verb is a modal verb,
which indicates a modality such as desire, permission or obligation.

**me vol te jam ba fito.**
– I want you to eat vegetables. (desire)  
**me sel te jam ba fito.**
– I advise you to eat vegetables. (advice)  
**me halal te jam ba fito.**
– I allow you to eat vegetables. (permission)  
**me bil te jam ba fito.**
– I enable you to eat vegetables. (ability)  
**me mus te jam ba fito.**
– I compel you to eat vegetables. (obligation)  
**me rai te jam ba fito.**
– I think you eat vegetables. (opinion)


## Verb series structure

There can be two, three or even more verbs in a series,
and all of them are about the same subject.
 
1. **me ga dom.**
   – I go home.  
2. **me bil ga dom.**
   – I can go home.  
3. **me vol bil ga dom.**
   – I want to be able to go home.
   (Word for word: _I want can go home_!)

The last verb in the series is the main verb.
The verbs before it are modal verbs.

**te vol jam yo fito.**
– You want to eat vegetables. (desire)  
**te sel jam yo fito.**
– You had better eat vegetables. (advice)  
**te halal jam yo fito.**
– You may eat vegetables. (permission)  
**te bil jam yo fito.**
– You can eat vegetables. (ability)  
**te mus jam yo fito.**
– You must eat vegetables. (obligation)

## Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity.
This is done especially in commands and requests.

### Short pivot structure (VOVO)

**me amir te kai la mun.**
– I command you to open the door.  
**amir te kai la mun.**
– Open the door!

### Short pivot structure (VVO)

**me ching te lai do dom.**
– I ask you to come home.  
**ching lai do dom!**
– Please come home!
(Word for word: _Request come home!_)


## Questions

### Yes-no questions

_Yes-no_ questions are questions that expect 'yes' or 'no' as answer.
The easiest way to form a yes-no question in Pandunia is to simply attach the particle
**he**
('eh', 'huh') to the end of a statement.

**te jam un piza.**
– You eat a pizza. (statement)  
**te jam un piza, he?**
– Do you eat a pizza? (question)

It is also possible to use
**no**
('no', 'not') or
**jo**
('yes') instead of
**he**
to suggest the expected answer.

**te jam un piza, no?**
– You eat a pizza, don't you?  
**te jam un piza, jo?**
– You eat a pizza, right?

The third way to ask a yes-no question is to contradict the verb
with the _A-not-A_ structure.

**te jam no jam un piza?**
– Do you or don't you eat a pizza?  
**te bil no bil jam un piza?**
– Can you or can't you eat a pizza?

Finally, you can emphasize the question by using **sual**.

**me sual, te jam un piza?**
– I ask do you eat a pizza?  
**sual te jam un piza?**
– Do you eat a pizza?

Yes-no questions are answered with
**ja**
('yes') and
**no**
('no').

**te vide me, he?**
– Do you see me?  
**ja. (me jo vide te.)**
– Yes. (I _do_ see you.)  
**no. (me no vide te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)

Negative questions are answered so that
**ja**
and
**no**
apply to the verb, not the whole question.

**te no vide me, he?**
– Don't you see me?  
**ja. (me vide te.)**
– Yes. (I see you.)  
**no. (me no vide te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)


### Alternative questions

Questions that offer alternatives end with the particle
**he**
or start with the word
**sual**
to indicate that an answer is expected.
The question is answered by repeating the chosen alternative.

**te jam un o du banana.**
– You eat one or two bananas. (statement)  
**te jam un o du banana, he?**
– Do you eat one or two bananas? (question)  
**un.**
– One.


## Open questions

Open questions, or _wh-_ questions, ask for more information.
In Pandunia they use the word **ke**.

**piza sa ke?**
– What is pizza?

The question word may be moved to the front of the sentence for emphasis.
However, unlike in English, the word order may also be left alone.

**ke she te zai jam?**
– What are you eating?  
**te zai jam ke she?**
– You are eating what?  
**le lai na ke sata?**
– When does he arrive?  
**tes keka na ke jen du dom?**
– Whose house did you all visit?


## Relative clauses

A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun phrase, most commonly a noun.
For example, the phrase "the person who lives there" containst the noun _person_,
which is modified by the relative clause _who lives there_.

There are different ways to build a relative clause in Pandunia.
The relative pronoun in Pandunia is **jo**
and it corresponds to English _that_, _who_ and _which_.

In Pandunia, relative clauses are always set off by commas.

**la buku, jo la jen fa kitabu, pade.**
– The book, which the person writes, falls.

It is possible to leave also **jo** out.
This structure is called _reduced relative clause_.

**la buku, la jen fa kitabu, pade.**
– The book the person writes falls.

The relative pronoun is necessary
when the relativized noun is the subject of the relative clause.

**la jen, jo fa kitabu la buku, pade.**
– The person that writes the book falls.

Also the object noun of a preposition can be the target of the relative clause.
It's possible to use relative pronouns or the reduced relative clause structure.

**la kalam, na jo la jen fa kitabu la buku, pade.**
– The pen, with _which_ the person writes the book, falls.  
**la kalam, la jen fa kitabu la buku na, pade.**
– The pen the person writes the book with falls.

The relative pronoun can be put in its right place in the pivot structure
or it can be left out by using the reduced relative clause structure.

**la jen, me vide jo fa kitabu la buku, pade.**
– The person, whom I see write the book, falls.  
**la jen, me vide fa kitabu la buku, pade.**
– The person that I see write the book falls.  

Also _resumptive relative pronoun_ can be used if needed.

**la jen, me fa kitabu la buku na jo du kalam, padu.**
– The person whose pen I write the book with falls.


## Content clauses

A content clause is a subordinate clause that provides content that is commented or referred to by its main clause.
In Pandunia they are typically introduced with the conjunction
**ki**.

**me sabe ki te sa doste.**
– I know that you are a friend.  
**les fikir ki mes leu chuti.**
– They think that we have left.

A content clause can be placed before or after the clause that talks about it.
The demonstrative
**go**
points to the following content clause and
**la**
points to the previous one.

**go sa bari, ki me leu no vide les.**
– _It_ is important _that I haven't seen them_.  
**ki pan jen be sana ka par, la sa klar.**
– _That all people are created as equals_; _it_ is clear.

The content clause marker
**ki**
can be combined to the prepositions in order to construct conjunctions of cause and purpose.

**do ki**
– so that, in order that, with the result that  
**ze ki**
– because, for the reason that

**me duku ni buku _do ki_ me transe la teste.**
– I read this book so that I will pass the test.  
**me leu transe la teste _ze ki_ me duku la buku.**
– I have passed the test because I read the book.


## Conditional sentences

There are three types of conditional sentences in Pandunia.

1. **gar A, asar B.**
   – If A, then B.
1. **gar A, B.**
   – If A, B.
1. **A, asar B.**
   – A, then B.

The conditional part of sentence normally starts with the word **gar**,
which means means 'to suppose' or 'if'.
The result part of the sentence may start withthe word **asar**,
which means 'to result' or 'then'.

Note that verbs are not marked in any special way in Pandunia.
There is no equivalent to the English auxiliary verb *would*.

**me no jama le, gar me sa te.**
– I wouldn't eat it _if_ I were you.  
**gar te no brosa dante, te deku kung.**
– If you don’t brush your teeth, you get cavities.  
**gar te shanti, te emosi mas bon.**
– If you rest, you will feel better.  
**gar te tochu la tava, asar te pasi la hande.**
– _If_ you touch the pan, _then_ you will hurt your hand.

Imaginary and unlikely situations can be framed with the verb **fantazi** 'to imagine'.

**fantazi mi ganya un mega euro, mi safar do la luna.**
– Imagine I would win a million euros, I would travel to the moon.

## Particles

### Affirmation and Negation

#### Affirmative

Expressions are affirmative by default.

**me sa shefe.**
– I am the boss.  
**le sa novi meza.**
– It is a new table.

Affirmation can be emphasized with the adverb
**jo**
('yes indeed').

**me jo sa shefe.**
– I indeed am the boss.  
**le jo sa novi meza.**
– It indeed is a new table.

#### Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

**le no sa shefe.**
– He is not the boss.  
**le no sa novi meza.**
– It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything.
It affects always the next word.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location of the negative word.

**me vide te.**
– I see you.  
**me no vide te.**
– I don't see you.  
**me vide no te a les.**
– I see, not you, but them.

**me ching te safa la kamar.**
– I ask you to clean the room.  
**me no ching te safa la kamar.**
– I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**me ching te no safa la kamar.**
– I ask you NOT to clean the room.


### Modifier particles

Particles **di** and **da** are used to link a noun, an adjective or a verb phrase to a noun to modify it.
**di** connects the modifying word or phrase to the main noun word.
**da** works in the opposite direction, it connects the main noun to the modifying word or phrase.

#### Modification with noun phrases

One way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun.
It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

**rodə rang di labi**
– rose-colored lips  
**samanə rang di yen**
– sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

**labi da rode rang**
– lips of the rose-color  
**yen da sama rang**
– eyes of the sky-color

The particles help in creating measure words too.
 
**un sake di patate**
– one sack of potatoes  
**du sake di patate**
– two sacks of potatoes  
**max sake di patate**
– more sacks of potatoes

Note that **di** and **da** connect phrases together.
So a modifier phrase with and without **da** can mean a different thing.

**max mei hua**
– more beautiful flowers  
**max di mei hua**
– more of beautiful flowers

#### Modification with verb phrases

Verbs are turned into modifiers by placing **da** or **di** immediately next to the verb.
Verb phrases can also be made into modifiers in this way, but any objects must be moved to before the verb.

**suta da grafi pente**
– the art of picture-painting (the art of painting pictures)  
**alo du mede du suka**
– the joy of others-helping (the joy of helping others)

#### Possession

The possessive particle
**du**
works like the apostrophe-s ('s) in English.
It indicates that the previous word has possession of the next one.

**Maria du mama**
– Maria's mother  
**Maria du mama du dom**
– Maria's mother's house

The same particle is used with with personal pronouns too.

**me du dom**
– my house  
**te du dom**
– your house  
**le du dom**
– his or her house  
**mes du dom**
– our house  
**tes du dom**
– your house  
**les du dom**
– their house


### Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed.
The general time words are **pas** (past), **zai** (present) and **sha** (future, upcoming).
They function like adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb.

**me pas ha mau.**
– I had cats.  
**a me no zai ha mau.**
– But I now don't have cats.  
**bil, me sha ha mau.**
– Maybe I will have cats.

It's also possible to say it in a longer way like **na pas zaman** (in the past) etc.

**me ha mau na pas zaman.**
– I had cats in the past.  
**a me no ha mau na zai zaman.**
– But I don't have cats at present.  
**bil, me ha mau na sha zaman.**
– Maybe I will have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated.
So the verb **ha** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary.
Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text
and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.
