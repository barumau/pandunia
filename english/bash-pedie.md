# Pandunia in education

## Foreword

Pandunia is not taught in any schools yet.
Therefore the contents of this article are hypothetical and based on experiences in teaching other languages.
However, it is clear that Pandunia would be an ideal language to be learned as the first foreign language
because it would prepare learners well and in a unique way to study other foreign languages.


## What is Pandunia?

Pandunia is a globally sourced constructed language
that combines different types of grammar and international words from all continents into one language.
It is a perfect language to be learned as the first foreign language because it prepares students to study other foreign languages in a unique way.
Pandunia helps students to identify and use

- the basic word classes
- different word orders
- analytic and synthetic grammar
- word derivation and structure of international words
- widely known words from Western, Asian and African cultures.

One year of learning Pandunia produces a language ability equivalent to what the average learner reaches with other languages after several years of study.
It is a first stepping stone that builds confidence and improves the ability of the student to learn any other language in the future.

One year of learning Pandunia also enables students to communicate well with a growing number of people
who have also learned this regular, flexible and multicultural language.


## How Pandunia works?

Learning Pandunia is a course in basic linguistics by itself.
There are three structural varieties of Pandunia
that familiarize learners with the most common types and structures of languages.
All varieties have the same underlying grammar but they emphasize different aspects of it,
which creates an illusion as if they would represent different typological language types.

1. **Mini Pandunia** is the simplest variety.
   It has only invariable words.
   It uses specific grammatical words and *no inflection* to indicate grammatical relationships.
   **Minimi Pandunia** is a version of Mini Pandunia that is restricted to only 150 words.
2. **Midi Pandunia** is a compromise between the extreme varieties.
   It uses *little inflection* to indicate grammatical relationships.
   It has exactly five inflectional suffixes, which are the famous five *word class markers*.
3. **Maxi Pandunia** is the most complicated variety.
   It uses *much inflection* to indicate grammatical relationships,
   and forms of words can change considerably.

The varieties are compatible with each other!
All of them have the same basic structure words and the same dictionary.
The most advanced variety, Maxi Pandunia, includes Midi Pandunia, which in turn includes Mini Pandunia and Minimi Pandunia.

The best way to get familiar with all the varieties is to learn the common, basic structure words.
The next step is to study Mini or Midi.

Learning Midi Pandunia gives a good understanding of grammar in general
because the mechanisms of grammar are made visible by the word class markers.
Midi Pandunia words consist of two parts:
a word stem and a *vowel ending* that indicates the word class.

- Adjectives end in ***-i***.
- Adverbs end in ***-o***.
- Nouns end in ***-e*** or the *zero ending*.
- Verbs end in ***-a*** or ***-u***.

Mini Pandunia is made from Midi Pandunia by stripping off the vowel endings
and replacing them with the neutral vowel ending ***-É™*** or the zero ending.
Only the essential stucture words, such as pronouns and prepositions, get to keep their original endings.
In the resulting simplified language, grammatical relations are expressed with a fixed word order instead of the word class markers,
and the essential stucture words hold sentences together.

Maxi Pandunia is made from Midi Pandunia by combining several meaningful roots into one word,
such as person and tense into verbs and possessive pronouns into nouns.
So the sentence in a way collapses into a smaller number of words
because more information is encoded into individual words.

Below is a simple demonstration where the same sentence is written in the three varieties of Pandunia.
The units of meaning are written in different colors to highlight the differences.

The three varieties of Pandunia can be used for different purposes.
Mini Pandunia is the natural choice for communication in rudimentary levels.
People can learn this variety easily on their own even without books or other learning materials.
Midi Pandunia is a good choice for literature, business and even legal documents.
Maxi Pandunia can be used in artistic expression, for example poetry and proverbs.


## Benefits of teaching Pandunia

Pandunia is a language with a clear, simple and regular structure.
It is a flexible language that can be molded for the needs of the curriculum.
Teachers can choose one of the three ready-made varieties of Pandunia, Mini, Midi and Maxi,
or use parts from all of them.

It is ideal also for teaching word derivation thanks to its agglutinative character.
Its words are strung together from easily identifiable morphemes like *beads on a string*.

Pandunia is also a multicultural language.
Its vocabulary is adopted from many languages around the world,
including Western languages, like English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Russian,
African languages, like Arabic, Swahili, Lingala, Hausa and Amharic,
and Asian languages, like Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, Bengali, Malay, Japanese, Korean and Chinese.
Pandunia is great for raising children to become world citizens.

One year of learning Pandunia produces a language ability
that is equivalent to what the average learner reaches with other languages after several years of study.
It is easy and rewarding to teach a regular language like Pandunia.
The teacher never has to say: "There is no explanation for it; it just is."
There is a logical explanation for everything in Pandunia!
Also students love to learn Pandunia thanks to its regularity and simplicity.
It is a learning experience that builds confidence and improves the ability of students to learn any other language in the future.

In addition, one year of learning Pandunia enables students to communicate well with a growing number of people
who have also learned this regular, flexible and multicultural language in school or in their free time.

## Are the benefits real?

There is a constructed language, somewhat similar to Pandunia, that has been taught in schools successfully.
It is **Esperanto**.
Esperanto is a regular language that is based on only European languages.
It has a reputation of being extremely simple but in fact it is approximately as complicated as the Maxi variety of Pandunia.
That is to say, the Mini and Midi varieties of Pandunia are simpler than Esperanto.

See the article [Propaedeutic value of Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto) in the Wikipedia.
