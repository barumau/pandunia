# Pandunia in education

## Foreword

Pandunia is not taught in any schools yet.
Therefore the contents of this article are hypothetical and based on experiences in teaching other languages.
However, it is clear that Pandunia would be an ideal language to be learned as the first foreign language
because it would prepare learners well and in a unique way to study other foreign languages.

## Benefits of teaching Pandunia

Pandunia is a language with a clear, simple and regular structure.
It is a flexible language that can be molded for the needs of the curriculum.
Teachers can choose one of the three ready-made varieties of Pandunia, Mini, Midi and Maxi,
or use parts from all of them.

It is ideal also for teaching word derivation thanks to its agglutinative character.
Its words are strung together from easily identifiable morphemes like *beads on a string*.

Pandunia is also a multicultural language.
Its vocabulary is adopted from many languages around the world,
including Western languages, like English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Russian,
African languages, like Arabic, Swahili, Lingala, Hausa and Amharic,
and Asian languages, like Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, Bengali, Malay, Japanese, Korean and Chinese.
Pandunia is great for raising children to become world citizens.

One year of learning Pandunia produces a language ability
that is equivalent to what the average learner reaches with other languages after several years of study.
It is easy and rewarding to teach a regular language like Pandunia.
The teacher never has to say: "There is no explanation for it; it just is."
There is a logical explanation for everything in Pandunia!
Also students love to learn Pandunia thanks to its regularity and simplicity.
It is a learning experience that builds confidence and improves the ability of students to learn any other language in the future.

In addition, one year of learning Pandunia enables students to communicate well with a growing number of people
who have also learned this regular, flexible and multicultural language in school or in their free time.

## Are the benefits real?

There is a constructed language, somewhat similar to Pandunia, that has been taught in schools successfully.
It is **Esperanto**.
Esperanto is a regular language that is based on only European languages.
It has a reputation of being extremely simple but in fact it is approximately as complicated as the Maxi variety of Pandunia.
That is to say, the Mini and Midi varieties of Pandunia are simpler than Esperanto.

See the article [Propaedeutic value of Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto) in the Wikipedia.
