# Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality or description,
such as good, bad, big, and fast, to another word.
In Pandunia, there is only one class of modifiers.
The same word can modify nouns and verbs,
whereas in English only _adjectives_ can modify nouns
and only _adverbs_ can modify verbs.
For example, the word
**sundar**
('beautiful' or 'beautifully')
modifies a noun in sentence A
and a verb in sentence B.

A. **go si un _sundar_ kitabu.**
– That is a beautiful writing.  
B. **tu _sundar_ di kitabu.**
– You write _beautifully_.


### Modifying nouns

In Pandunia, "adjectives" are modifiers that are placed before the noun that they modify.

**un _nove_ kar**
– a _new_ car  
**un _rapide_ kar**
– a _fast_ car  
**ba _dai_ meza**
– _big_ tables  
**ba _gau_ meza**
– high tables  
**un bon jen**
– a good person

Two or more modifiers can modify the same noun.

**un lili nove kar**
– a little new car


### Modifying verbs

A modifier that modifies a verb
is placed immediately before the verb.

**tu _rapide_ loga.**
– You talk _fast_.  
**yemon _bon_ kitabu.**
– They write _well_.

It is common to put the modifying particle
**di**
between the modifier and the verb.
It makes the structure of the verb phrase clearer.

**tu _sundar di_ kitabu.**
– You write _beautifully_.  
**yemon _rapide di_ marche.**
– They walk _fast_.


### Modifying other modifiers

The particle
**di**
is used also when a modifier modifies another one.

**un _surpris di_ bon buku**
– a _surprisingly_ good book  
**ba _lika di_ ama ja jen**
– _strongly_ loving people


#### Degree words

Degree words tell us about the intensity of something.

**tre**
– very  
**basa**
– quite, sufficiently, enough  
**mas**
– more  
**min**
– less
**mas ka basa**
– too  

Degree words are placed before the word that they modify.

**un dai man**
– a big man  
**un tre dai man**
– a very big man  
**un basa dai man**
– a big enough man / a sufficiently big man
**un mas dai man ka basa**
– a too big man  

A degree word together with a modifier forms a _compound adverb_
that can modify a verb or a sentence.
The compound adverb is placed immediately before the verb that it modifies.

**tre muche**
– very much  
**mi _tre muche_ vol loga.**
– I want very much to speak.  
**mi vol _tre muche_ loga.**
– I want to speak very much.

It is also possible to place the compound adverb very last in the sentence,
and then it modifies the sentence as a whole.
The meaning is the same like when the compound adverb modifies the main verb.

**mi vol loga _tre muche_.**
– I want to speak very much.  
**sual tu sona _bas bon_?**
– Did you sleep well enough?


### Adverbs of comparison

Adjectives can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- **mas**
  (_more_) indicates comparison of superiority
- **masim**
  (_most_) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim**
  (_least_) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **par**
  (_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**ka**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple si mas bon ka oranje.**
= Apples are better than oranges.  
**oranje si min bon ka aple.**
= Oranges are less good than apples.  
**tu loga par bon ka mi.**
= You speak as well as me.
