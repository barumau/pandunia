# Modifiers

## Adjectives

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to another word,
for example good, bad, big, and fast.

### Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun.
In Pandunia, adjectives are placed before the noun that they modify.

**nove gar**
– new car(s)  
**rapide gar**
– fast car(s)  
**dai meza**
– big table(s)  
**gau meza**
– high table(s)  
**bon kursi**
– good chair(s)

Two or more adjectives can modify the same word.

**lili nove gar**
– a little, new car

Adjective can be also after the noun.
Often this type of phrases can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

**gar nove.**
– The car is new.  
**bagre rapide.**
– The tiger is fast.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

**nove gar rapide.**
– The new car is fast.


## Adverbs

There are two types of adverbs in Pandunia,
adverbs of degree
and adverbs of comparison.

### Adverbs of degree

Adverbs of degree tell us about the intensity of something.

**tre**
– very  
**tai**
– too  
**bas**
– quite, sufficiently, enough  
**max**
– more  
**min**
– less

Adverbs of degree are placed before the adjective that they modify.

**un dai man**
– a big man  
**un tre dai man**
– a very big man  
**un tai dai man**
– a too big man  
**un bas dai man**
– a big enough man / a sufficiently big man

The adverb and adjective together form a compound adverb
that can modify a verb or a sentence.
The compound adverb is placed immediately before the verb that it modifies.

**tre muche**
– very much
**mi _tre muche_ vol loga.**
– I want very much to speak.  
**mi vol _tre muche_ loga.**
– I want to speak very much.

It is also possible to place the compound adverb very last in the sentence,
and then it modifies the sentence as a whole.
The meaning is the same like when the compound adverb modifies the main verb.

**mi vol loga _tre muche_.**
– I want to speak very much.  
**sual tu sona _bas bon_?**
– Did you sleep well enough?


### Adverbs of comparison

Adjectives can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- **max**
  (_more_) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim**
  (_most_) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim**
  (_least_) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **par**
  (_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**ka**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple e max bon ka oranje.**
= Apples are better than oranges.  
**oranje e min bon ka aple.**
= Oranges are less good than apples.  
**tu loga par bon ka mi.**
= You speak as well as me.
