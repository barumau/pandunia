# Verbs

Verbs are unchanging in Pandunia.
Things like person, number, time and mood are indicated by separate words,
not by changing the form of verbs as in English and other languages.

## Person and number

Person and number are indicated by the subject.
For example, the verb
**sa**
('to be') has the same form for all persons.

**_me_ sa doste.**
– I am a friend.  
**_te_ sa doste.**
– You are a friend.  
**_le_ sa doste.**
– He or she is a friend.  
**_mes_ sa doste.**
– We are friends.  
**_tes_ sa doste.**
– You are friends.  
**_les_ sa doste.**
– They are friends.

Also a noun can serve as subject.

**mau sa zou.**
– The cat is an animal.

Frequently there is a marker between the subject and the verb
to indicate where the subject ends and the verb begins.
It is particularly helpful when the subject and the verb are content words
that could serve as both.
The marker is typically a particle or an auxiliary verb.
One of the many suitable markers is
**jo**
('yes'),
which adds no content to the sentence
but helps to clarify its structure.

**peshe sa mau jam.**
– Fish is catfood.  
**mau _jo_ jam peshe.**
– The cat eats some fish.

Other suitable markers include auxiliaries of time and mood,
which are introduced next.


### Verb types

There are three types of verbs in Pandunia:

1. Agent-oriented verbs:
   The subject does the action in the SVO word order.
   The the verb ends in **-a**.
2. Patient-oriented verbs:
   The subject "suffers" the action in the SVO word order.
   The verb ends in **-u**.
3. Stative verbs:
   The subject is in the state that is indicated by the verb.
   The verb ends in **-i**.

Consider the following examples:  
**me safa.**
– I clean. (active verb)  
**me safa kamar.**
– I clean a room. (active verb with an object)  
**kamar safu.**
– The room is cleaned. (passive verb)  
**kamar safu me.**
– The room is cleaned by me. (passive verb with postponed agent)  
**kamar safi.**
– The room is clean. (stative verb)

As you can see, **-a** and **-u** indicate opposite orders of the agent and patient.


#### Agent-oriented verbs

Verbs that end in **-a** are called _agent-oriented verbs_
because the agent comes before the verb.
The agent and patient are arranged around the verb as depicted in the figure below.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/eng_agent-verb-patient.png "Agent-verb-patient cycle")

There can be only one verb, one agent, and one patient
one after another in a sentence.
The word order cycle is unfolded by removing one of the three arrows.
This results into following three word orders:

1. Agent – verb – patient
2. Patient – agent – verb
3. Verb – patient – agent

If there is a word immediately before the verb, it is the agent.
If there is a word immediately after the verb, it is the patient.


##### Order A-1: Agent, verb and patient

The most common word order in Midi Pandunia is agent–verb–patient.
It is used typically in the active voice, where the the focus is on the agent (i.e. the doer) of the action.

Examples:  
**me vida les.**
– I see them.  
**te beka pang.**
– You bake bread.  

##### Order A-2: Patient, agent and verb

The second order is patient–agent–verb.
It is frequent in dependant clauses.

Examples:  
**ke te vida?**
– What do you see?  
**me jama pang, de te beka.**
– I eat bread _that you baked._

##### Order A-3: Verb, patient and agent

The third order is the verb-patient-agent, which is rarely used.
It is described here only for the sake of completeness.



#### Patient-oriented verbs

Verbs that end in **-u** are called _patient-oriented verbs_
because the patient comes before the verb.
The agent and patient are arranged around the verb as depicted in the figure below.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/eng_patient-verb-agent.png "Patient-verb-agent cycle")

There can be only one verb, one agent, and one patient.
Therefore it is possible to put them in exactly three different orders:

1. Patient – verb – agent
2. Agent – patient – verb
3. Verb – agent – patient

The arguments of patient-oriented verbs are exactly in the opposite order
compared to agent-oriented verbs.

##### Order U-1: Patient, verb and agent

The patient-verb-agent order is common in the passive voice,
where the focus is on the passive recipient of the action.

Often they can be translated to English by using the passive voice or an intransitive verb
but sometimes a transitive verb can be used too.

Examples:  
**pang beku te.**
– Bread is baked by you.  
**kupe parcu.**
– The cup got broken.  
**reger suku les.**
– The king is pleased by them.

##### Order U-2: Agent, patient and verb

The agent–patient–verb order is a possible alternative for the agent–verb–patient order.
It is used in the active voice, where the the focus is on the agent (i.e. the doer) of the action.

Examples:  
**me les vidu.** - _I them see._  
**te pang beku.** - _You bread bake._

##### Order U-3: Verb, agent and patient

The verb–agent–patient order is very rare but possible.
It is described here only for the sake of completeness.



#### Stative verbs

Verbs that end in **-i** are called _stative verbs_.
They are basically adjectives that describe the subject in a verb-like manner.
The subject of a stative verb is in the state denoted by the verb root.

Stative verbs differ from passive verbs by the fact that
a stative verb is about being in a state
whereas a passive verb indicates a change of state.
In other words, a stative verb is a _passive of being_
and a passive verb is a _passive of becoming_.

Stative verbs are always intransitive.
They can't have an object.


## Auxiliaries of time

The relationship of an action, event or state to time is indicated with auxiliary verbs.

**te shuru yam.**
– You start to eat.

**fin**
('end, cease, quit, stop')
conveys the idea of "to stop doing something".

**les fin haha.**
