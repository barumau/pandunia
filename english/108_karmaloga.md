# Verbs

Verbs are unchanging in Pandunia.
Things like person, number, time and mood are indicated by separate words,
not by changing the form of verbs as in English and other languages.

## Person and number

Person and number are indicated by the subject.
For example, the verb
**si**
('to be') has the same form for all persons.

**_mi_ si doste.**
– I am a friend.  
**_tu_ si doste.**
– You are a friend.  
**_ya_ si doste.**
– He or she is a friend.  
**_mimon_ si doste.**
– We are friends.  
**_tumon_ si doste.**
– You are friends.  
**_yemon_ si doste.**
– They are friends.

Also a noun can serve as subject.

**mau si zou.**
– The cat is an animal.

Frequently there is a marker between the subject and the verb
to indicate where the subject ends and the verb begins.
It is particularly helpful when the subject and the verb are content words
that could serve as both.
The marker is typically a particle or an auxiliary verb.
One of the many suitable markers is
**ya**
('yes'),
which adds no content to the sentence
but helps to clarify its structure.

**peshe si mau yam.**
– Fish is catfood.  
**mau _ye_ yam a peshe.**
– The cat eats fish.

Other suitable markers include auxiliaries of time and mood,
which are introduced next.


## Auxiliaries of time

**mi kai fuku la kote.**

**kaguje ya kai hoge.**
