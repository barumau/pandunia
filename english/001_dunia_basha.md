# Pandunia - a global contact language
 
## Introduction

This article describes why and how Pandunia was created
to be an equally global auxiliary language.

## The big picture

Many people are used to seeing this kind of world map.
It is the famous _Mercator projection_ map.
Unfortunately it distorts the land area terribly.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/metrograf_da_merkator.jpg "Mercator projection")

Why is that? The world is a 3-dimensional globe and drawing it into a flat, 2-dimensional map is not easy.
Equal-area projections, such as the _Equal Earth projection_ below,
show land areas correctly.
Compare the sizes of Greenland and Africa in these two maps.
In the Mercator projection Greenland appears bigger,
but the Equal Earth projection shows correctly that in reality Africa is 14 times bigger than Greenland.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/metrograf_da_pari_gevia.jpg "Equal Earth projection")

That is the natural world.
We live also in a human world, which comprises of nations that are divided by borders.
In a normal map of countries of the world, sizes of the countries are defined by their geographic area.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/metrograf_da_aria.png "Map by area")

However the map projection below is based on the population of countries, not on their geographic area.

![](http://www.pandunia.info/grafe/karte_da_insania.png "Map by Population 2018")

In our opinion the world language should represent the human world.
Every part of the world, every culture, should be treated fairly and democratically.
The grammar should be easy for all.
Areal linguistic characteristics, such as [Standard Average European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European),
are not suitable guidelines for the world language.
Instead, the grammar should be built from things that are universally known and/or universally considered easy.


## Cultures of the world

Hartmut Traunmuller divided the world into four major cultural spheres in his article
[A Universal Interlanguage: Some Basic Considerations](http://www.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/UIL.pdf).
The languages within a certain cultural sphere share words (loan words and translated loan words) and cultural concepts.

1. The Western (or the European) cultural sphere
    - This sphere covers all of Europe, Americas, Australia and various smaller regions.
    - Languages of the West have been influenced greatly by Greek and Latin and in modern times by French and English.
2. The Afro-Asian (or the Islamic) cultural sphere
    - This group includes languages of areas where Islam is the main religion.
    - It spans from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the islands in the Pacific of Indonesia and the Philippines.
    - The languages of this cultural sphere are influenced by Persian and especially Arabic, which is the language of Quran, the holy book of Islam.
3. The South Asian (or the Indian) cultural sphere
    - This sphere covers the very populous subcontinent of India, Indochina and more
    - The classical language of this group are Sanskrit, Tamil and Pāli
    - The Indian vocabulary has been spread by Hinduism and especially Buddhism in all directions in Asia and elsewhere.
4. The East Asian (or the Chinese) cultural sphere
    - This culturel sphere grew around ancient China, the Middle Kingdom
    - All languages of East Asia are saturated by loan words from Chinese.
    - The biggest modern Chinese language, Mandarin, competes for the title of the most spoken language in the world today.

The cultural spheres are roughly outlined in the picture below.

## Languages of the world and world languages

It is estimated that over 6000 different languages are spoken in the world.
Some languages are spoken by many while others are spoken by only a few.
Native and non-native speakers of the five most widely spoken languages together
add up to more than half of the total population of the world.
It is impossible to include all languages into the construction of a world language because of their great number.
The number of source languages should be manageable for one person to work with.

So, which languages should be taken in?

[Power Language Index](http://www.kailchan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kai-Chan_Power-Language-Index-full-report_2016_v2.pdf)
(PLI) provides an answer to this question.
It is a tool for comparing efficacy of languages that has been created by Ph.D. Kai L. Chan.
It compares languages on how well they provide to a speaker the following five opportunities:

1. Geography: The ability to travel
2. Economy: The ability to participate in economic activities
3. Communication: The ability to participate in dialogue
4. Knowledge and media: The ability to consume knowledge and media
5. Diplomacy: The ability to engage in international relations

Chan builds a ranking of languages based on a combination of the above-listed opportunities.
This ranking is used as a reference in Pandunia.

### The main source languages for Pandunia

Most Pandunia words are borrowed from the following 14 widely spoken languages.
The languages are selected so that they represent different language families,
different geographical regions and different cultures.

The following table is ordered by the rank in the Power Language Index.
The numbers of speakers are from the Power Language Index and the Wikipedia.

| Language         | Native speakers | Non-native speakers | PLI ranking | Cultural sphere |
|:-----------------|----------------:|--------------------:|:--:|:--------------------|
| English          |     446 million |  510 million        |  1 | Western             |
| Mandarin Chinese |     960 million |  178 million        |  2 | East Asian          |
| French           |      80 million |  192 million        |  3 | Western             |
| Spanish          |     470 million |   70 million        |  4 | Western             |
| Arabic           |     295 million |  132 million        |  5 | Afro-Asian          |
| Russian          |     150 million |  115 million        |  6 | Western             |
| Hindi-Urdu       |     442 million |  214 million        |  8 | Indian & Afro-Asian |
| Japanese         |     125 million |    1 million        |  9 | East Asian          |
| Portuguese       |     215 million |   32 million        | 10 | Western             |
| Malay            |      77 million |  204 million        | 14 | Indian & Afro-Asian |
| Korean           |      80 million |    1 million        | 16 | East Asian          |
| Bengali          |     210 million |   19 million        | 30 | Indian & Afro-Asian |
| Swahili          |      20 million |   80 million        | 37 | Afro-Asian          |

The numbers make it clear that Mandarin Chinese is by far the largest language by number of native speakers,
while English is the language with the greatest number of second language speakers.
Both of them are spoken by over one billion speakers in total.
However they are followed by languages, whose speakers are also counted in hundreds of millions.


## Spelling and pronunciation

### The most widely used alphabet

There are many writing systems in the world today
but only a handful of them are international.
The most popular writing systems are the Roman alphabet,
the Cyrillic alphabet, the Arabic script and the Chinese pictographic symbols.

Only the Roman alphabet has become truly global.
Most languages of Europe, the Americas and Africa are written in the Roman alphabet.
Also several notable languages in Asia,
including Turkish, Malay and Vietnamese,
are written in the Roman alphabet.

Therefore the Roman alphabet is the obvious choice for the international language.

### Only six vowels

According to [chapter 2](https://wals.info/chapter/1) of The World Atlas of Language Structures,
the vowel inventories in world's languages are categorized by size as follows:

- small: 2-4 vowels
- average: 5-6 vowels
- large: 7-14 vowels

Pandunia has only six pure vowels: a, e, i, o, u, ə.
The number is approximately the same as the global average.
In this respect, Pandunia is close to languages like
Malay (6 vowels) and Russian (6 vowels).

Examples of large vowel inventories include English (12 vowels) and Mandarin (9 vowels).


### Common consonants

According to [chapter 1](https://wals.info/chapter/1) of The World Atlas of Language Structures,
the consonant inventories in world's languages are categorized by size as follows:

- small: 6-14 consonants
- moderately small: 15-18
- average: 19-25
- moderately large: 26-33
- large: 34 or more consonants

Pandunia has only 18 consonants so its consonant inventory is moderately small.

English and Mandarin, for example, have much bigger consonant inventories.
Most consonant letters are pronounced in the same way in all three languages.
The table below shows what consonant sounds correspond to each other in Pandunia, English and Mandarin.
Sounds that are present in English or Mandarin but not in Pandunia are inside parenthesis.

|            | Pandunia    | English       | Mandarin Pinyin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Nasals     | m n ng      | m n ng        | m n ng          |
| Stops      | p b t d k g | p b t d k g   | p b t d k g     |
| Liquids    | l r j v     | l r y w       | l r y w (yü)    |
| Sibilants  | s z         | s z (sh zh)   | s z* (sh x)     |
| Fricatives | f h         | f h (v th th) | f h             |
| Affricates | c           | ch (j)        | c (ch zh q j)   |


### Easy to pronounce

A syllable consists of one core vowel and possible consonants.
In some languages syllables are simpler than in others.
For example in Japanese the heaviest syllables
consist of an initial consonant, a vowel and a final nasal consonant.
This is why Japanese sounds light and vocalic.
In English, on the other hand, it is possible to cram many consonants in one syllable, as in
"strict sprints".

Pandunia is somewhere in the middle.
Most syllables are simple a-consonant-and-a-vowel pairs
but also more complex syllables are allowed,
especially in internationally known technical terms.
For example **kristal** (crystal) is a complex word by Pandunia standards.

There are two ways to simplify words that are too complex for the international language:

1. Select a simpler variant of the same word from another language.
   For example, the English word _project_ ends in two consonants
   but the same word in Portuguese is _projeto_.
2. Break the consonant clusters by adding vowels.
   For example, the English word _sport_ is too complex
   but the same word in Portuguese is _esporte_,
   which breaks the difficult consonant clusters in the beginning and end
   by additional vowels.


### Regular spelling

English spelling is notoriously irregular. Pīnyīn was created more
recently, in the 1950s, but unfortunately it also has some
irregularities, simply because there are more sounds in spoken
Chinese than there are letters in the Roman alphabet. Still, in
comparison to English, Pinyin is very regular. For example the
English rhymes _my, sigh, lie,_ and _rye_ would be written in Pīnyīn
_mai, sai, lai, rai_. It is as simple as that!

Pandunia can be spelled regularly because it has fewer speech sounds (24)
than there are letters in the basic Roman alphabet (26).
The alphabet of Pandunia is:  
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p r s t u v x ə z

Pandunia has almost perfect letter-to-sound correspondence.
One letter stands for one sound only.
One sound is represented by exactly one letter.
Every word is pronounced as it is written.


### Regular accent

Pandunia has a regular accent.
The place of the stress is decided by one simple rule:
the last vowel of the word stem is stressed.
It goes like this:  
**haló'! mé vóla lóga lə bóni dúnia básə.**  
(_Hello! I want to speak the good world language._)

Regular stress is easier to learn and more comfortable to use
than irregular and unpredictable stress.
English is an example of a language with irregular stress.
In a written expression like
"totally fantastic personnel",
nothing shows that each word has the stress on a different syllable.
If the stress was marked on the vowels, it might look something like this:
"tótally fantástic personnél".

Pandunia doesn't have tones either.
Chinese, on the other hand, is a tonal language.
That's why texts in romanized Chinese are loaded with accent marks, as in
*wǒmen yě huì shuō zhōngguòhuá*.
They are there to mark tones.
In Standard Chinese, each syllable is pronounced in one of the four tones or in the unmarked neutral tone.

Tones are hard to learn for people who are not used to them.
Variable stress is hard to learn for people who are used to fixed stress.
Neither word tone nor variable word stress are necessary in the world language.


## The simplest structure

Languages can be categorized by two parameters:

- Is a single word made of few or many parts?
- Are those parts easy to separate or fused together?

The widely spoken languages can be categorized into four types according to these parameters.

1. Analytic languages – Words are made of few, distinct parts.
    - Mandarin Chinese
2. Analytic fusional languages – Words are made of few, fused parts.
    - English
3. Agglutinative languages – Words are made of many, distinct parts.
    - Japanese, Malay-Indonesian, Telugu
4. Synthetic fusional languages – Words are made of many, fused parts.
    - Spanish, Portuguese, French
    - German, Russian
    - Hindi-Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi
    - Arabic, Hausa

Usually languages are a mixture of different types.
For example, in English the plural can be formed in several different ways.
_Many a cat_ is an analytic phrase that consists of three separate words.
_Cats_ is an agglutinative word that consists of two distincts parts, _cat_ and _-s_.
_Leaves_ is a fused word that consists of two parts, _leaf_ and _-s_.

Pandunia is an analytic language.
Its words consist of few parts and they are clearly separable.
This is a good thing because it makes the language easy to learn and use
in comparison to languages where words are longer or fused of many parts.


### Parts of word

The word is made of a root and optional affixes, which are attached to the root word.
Prefixing languages put affixes before the root and
suffixing languages put affixes after the root.
Some languages put affixes on both sides or even inside the root.
Usually languages use several different ways.
For example English uses both prefixes (ex. un-kind) and suffixes (ex. kind-ly).

Suffixing languages are the most common type.
Indo-European languages, Telugu, Chinese and Japanese are mostly suffixing.

Chinese has no inflection.
Words are only combined into larger words.
Some words have a special meaning when they appear as a part of a larger word.
These so called bound morphemes are much like suffixes.

English, Spanish and Hindi-Urdu use mainly _root and affix system_.
The meaning is changed by adding dependent parts before and after the root.
For example "booklets" consists of root _book_ and affixes _-let_ (which adds meaning of smallness) and _-s_ (which adds plural meaning).
Most affixes can't stand alone, they always need to be fixed to a root.

Arabic uses transfixes.
The root consists of (usually three) consonants and it is changed by inserting a pattern of vowels between them.
Arabic also has many prefixes and suffixes for creating additional words.

Pandunia uses the simple root-and-affix system.
Its words can consist of many, distinct parts
that are easy to separate.
Everybody can create new words easily.


### Word orders

Different word orders are used in the languages of the world.
Some of the most important areas of word order are:

- Sentence structure.
  Order of subject (S), verb (V) and object (O) in a transitive clause.
  The most common sentence structures are subject–verb–object (SVO) and subject–object–verb (SOV).
- Order of numeral and noun.
  Cardinal numeral can be either before (NumN) or after (NNum) the noun.
- Order of adjective and noun. There are two possible orders
    1. Adjective is before the noun (AdjN)
    2. Adjective is after the noun (NAdj)
- Order of adposition and noun.
    1. Prepositions are before the noun.
    2. Postpositions are after the noun.
- Order of relative clause and noun.
  The relative clause can be either before (RelN) or after (NRel) the noun.

The table below shows what are the typical, unmarked word orders in important world languages.

| Language   | Sentence | Numeral | Adjective | Relative | Adposition |
|------------|:--------:|:-------:|:---------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| English    | SVO      | NumN    | AdjN      | NRel     | pre        |
| Chinese    | SVO      | NumN    | AdjN      | RelN     | post       |
| Spanish    | SVO      | NumN    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |
| Hindi-Urdu | SOV      | NumN    | AdjN      | RelN     | post       |
| Arabic     | VSO      | both    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |
| Russian    | SVO      | NumN    | AdjN      | NRel     | pre        |
| French     | SVO      | NumN    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |
| Indonesian | SVO      | NumN    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |
| Japanese   | SOV      | NumN    | AdjN      | RelN     | post       |
| Swahili    | SVO      | NNum    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |

Also other word orders are possible.
For example in English, which normally uses the SVO order in declarative sentences,
the object can be fronted in interrogative and relative clauses,
as in "What did you say?"

The previous table shows that the major languages don't agree about word orders.
Pandunia supports several word orders
but the default is to use the most common ones:
subject–verb–object (SVO),
numeral before the noun,
adjective before the noun,
relative clause after the noun
and prepositions.

 
## World words

Most Pandunia words are already international – at least in some part of the world!
The three key principles for selecting words for Pandunia are:

- **Equality** : Words are be borrowed equally from different regions of the world.
  In practice it means that Pandunia borrows words from the languages of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas.
- **Prevalence** : Widely spread words are favored.
  The more people know the word the better.
- **Simplicity** : Word forms with easy pronunciation are favored.


### Imitative words are global

Words whose sound imitates the sound of the associated thing or action are remarkably similar from language to language.
The cat says _miaow_, the goat says _bee_,
and people say _yum_ when they eat and _atchoo_ when they sneeze
everywhere in the world.
The words are not always exactly the same in every language but they are close enough.

This is why Pandunia has for example these basic global words:  
**mau**
– cat  
**behe**
– goat  
**meme**
– sheep  
**mumu**
– cow  
**jam**
– to eat
**aci**
– to sneeze  
**ronfi**
– to snore

However, most words are not global.
Therefore it is necessary to establish a systematic method for word adoption.

### Word selection method

Because the languages constantly influence each other, there are a lot of international words.
Some words are international in the West, some in the East, and some are even global.
Pandunia attempts to use as international, intercontinental and global words as possible.

Words that are specific to a certain culture shall be adopted from languages that best represent that culture.

Words for objects of nature (for example plants and animal species) shall be adopted from a language that is spoken in the area where that object is found.

So the first question is, does the word _belong_ to a certain region or culture?

Yes. → Select the word from languages that are important in that region or culture.  
No. → Use the following word selection method.

1. Collect translations for a given word in the 12 languages or language teams that are listed below
   by using electronic or printed dictionaries, Wiktionary, Google Translate, or some other tool.
2. Identify groups of similar words.
    - Similar words can be historically related
    - or they can sound alike by coincidence.
3. Select the most international group of similar words.
    - The more international, the better.
    - The best words are cross-cultural.
    - If there's no cross-cultural word, select the one that is known by the greatest number of 1st language speakers.
4. Select a word form that represents the group well and fits into Pandunia well.
    - Strip off unnecessary prefixes and suffixes.
    - Use [the sounds, the spelling and the normal word structure](102_ABC.md) of Pandunia.
    - Make sure that the new word is not identical or too similar to any already existing Pandunia word.

The list of source languages for general words:

1. English
2. French
3. Spanish and/or Portuguese
4. Russian
5. Arabic
6. Mandarin
7. Japanese
8. Korean and/or Vietnamese
9. Hindi and/or Urdu
10. Bengali
11. Malay
12. Swahili

Normally a word appears in at least two of the source languages.
In case there isn't a common word, partially similar words can be selected.
Only in the last resort a word from only one language can be accepted.


### Example: Selecting the word for "language"

First possible candidates are searched from widely spoken languages.
The search reveals that there are several words that are international.

- Arabic لغة /luɣa/ is also known in Swahili _lugha_.
  It is also known in Persian and Turkic languages but with the meaning "dictionary".
- Persian زبان /zæba:n/ has spread to Urdu and Punjabi among others.
- Latinate _lingua_ is found in the Romance languages and it has spread to most European languages
  in words like _linguistics_ and _multilingual_.
- Indo-Aryan भाषा /bʱaʂa/ is used in Hindi and Bangla and it has spread to several neighbouring languages
  including Telugu, Thai and Indonesian.

The most prevalent of these words is /bʱaʂa/.
It is recognised nearly everywhere in India, Indochina and Malay archipelago,
which are some of the most densely populated areas in the world.

| Language   | Spoken word  | Written word    |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Hindi      | bʱaʂa        | भाषा          |
| Punjabi    | bʱaʃa         | ਭਾਸ਼ਾ          |
| Gujarati   | bʱaʃa        | ભાષા          |
| Marathi    | bʱaɕa        | भाषा          |
| Bangla     | bʱaʃa        | ভাষা           |
| Telugu     | baʃa         | భాష          |
| Thai       | pʰa:sa:      | ภาษา         |
| Indonesian | bahasa       | bahasa          |
| Javanese   | basa         | basa            |
| Sundanese  | basa         | basa            |

As you can see, the same word is written and pronounced differently in different languages.
This is typical of international words.
They get adapted in almost every language to their own spelling system.
Likewise it is necessary to adapt this word to the spelling and pronunciation rules of Pandunia.
So the Pandunia word for language becomes **basha**.


### Western words
 
Typically Western words have this structure: prefix + root +
suffixes. Usually the root ends in a consonant.

For example in Spanish, the root cort- (short) can be combined with
affixes to produce different kinds of words.

- Adjectives: corto (masc.), corta (fem.)
- Noun: cortedad
- Verb: acortar

Also English uses comparable affixes.

- Adjectives: short, shorter, shortest
- Nouns: shortness, shorty
- Verb: shorten

Pandunia borrows the roots of Western words. The goal is to select a
form that sounds familiar to speakers of as many languages as possible.

| Pandunia word | English    | Portuguese | Spanish    | French     | German     | Russian    |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **korte**     | short      | curto      | corto      | court      | kurz       | korotkiy   |
| **nove**      | new        | novo       | nuevo      | nouveau    | neu        | novıy      |
| **marche**    | march      | marcha     | marcha     | marche     | Marsch     | marš       |
| **poste**     | post (mail)| (postal)   | posta      | poste      | Post       | počta      |


### Sinitic words

Sinitic words are words from Middle Chinese that are used today in
languages of East Asia, including Chinese languages, Japanese, Korean
and Vietnamese. Sinitic words are single-syllable words or compounds
of syllabic elements.

Middle Chinese had lexical tone. Today Chinese languages and
Vietnamese have tones but they are not the same as in Middle Chinese.
Japanese and Korean are not tonal languages so they have ignored the
tones. Also Pandunia ignores the tones. (To ignore the tones is about
the same as to ignore the stress accent or pitch accent of other
source languages.)

Middle Chinese had unreleased stop consonants, which are usually
written -p, -t and -k. Cantonese, Vietnamese and Korean keep them
mostly as they were. Mandarin has deleted them. Japanese has added a
vowel to ease pronunciation. Pandunia keeps the final stops and adds
a normal PoS suffix.
 
| 字 | Pandunia root | Cantonese  | Mandarin   | Japanese   | Korean     | Vietnamese |
|----|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 水 | **sui**       | sui        | shuǐ       | sui        | su         | thuỷ       |
| 中 | **zung**      | zung       | zhōng      | chū        | jung       | trung      |
| 心 | **sim**       | sam        | xīn        | shin       | sim        | tâm        |
| 門 | **mun**       | mun        | mén        | mon        | mun        | (môn)      |
| 讀 | **dukə**      | duk        | dú         | doku       | dog        | đọc        |
| 出 | **chutə**     | cœt        | chū        | shutsu     | chul       | xuất       |

Applying the suffixes of Pandunia to Sinitic roots may seem unusual at first, but it is nothing new
– Sinitic words are already inflected in Korean!

### Examples of global words

#### bir 'beer'

| Language   | Spoken word  | Written word    |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| German     | bi:ɐ         | Bier            |

## Easy sentences

In this section we will compare the sentence structures of Pandunia with English and Chinese,
the two most widely spoken languages of the world.

The normal sentence word order is subject–verb–object
– just like in English and Chinese.

    English:   I love you, and you love me.
    Pandunia:  me ama te, te ama me.
    Chinese:   Wǒ ài nǐ, nǐ ài wǒ. (我爱你，你爱我。)

The auxiliary verb **be** is used when the object of the action comes first in the sentence.
(This is the so called passive sentence.)

    English:   Apples were eaten.
    Pandunia:  aple bei jam.
    Chinese:   Píngguǒ bèi chī le. (苹果被吃了。)

**bei** is a loan word from Standard Chinese,
but it is also close to some uses of English "to be".

    English:   It can not be eaten.
    Pandunia:  le no bil bei jam.
    Chinese:   Tā bù néng bèi chī. (它不能被吃。)

Like Chinese, Pandunia doesn't mark verbs with a word like "to".

    English:   I invite him to drink coffee.
    Pandunia:  mi ching le jam kafe.
    Chinese:   Wǒ qǐng tā hē kāfēi. (我请他喝咖啡。)

In Pandunia and Chinese, nouns can be singular or plural depending on surrounding words.
There's no plural ending like -s in English.
Also verbs are not conjugated.
One word, **sa**, is used instead of
_am, is, are, was, were..._

    English:   It is an apple.
    Pandunia:  le sa aple.
    Chinese:   Tā shì píngguǒ. (他是苹果。)

    English:   They are apples.
    Pandunia:  les sa aple.
    Chinese:   Tāmen shì píngguǒ. (他们是苹果。)
