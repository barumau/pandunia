# Midi Pandunia

Midi Pandunia is a variety of Pandunia language that is both simple and flexible.
It uses a system of five **word class markers** to arrange words in sentences.
Its words consist of two parts:
a word stem and a word class marker, which is one of the five vowels.

- Every adjective ends in ***-i***.
- Every adverb ends in ***-o***.
- Every verb ends in ***-a*** or ***-u***.
- Most nouns end in ***-e*** (and the rest have a *zero ending*).

Midi Pandunia is a good place to start learning Pandunia.
Mini Pandunia is a reduced variety and Maxi Pandunia is an enriched variety of Midi Pandunia.


## The basic rules of Midi Pandunia

These are the basic rules of Midi Pandunia language.
They are described in more detail later in this document.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2. The last syllable of the word stem is stressed.
3. Words consist of a stem and one or more suffixes.
   The last suffix indicates the word class to which the word belongs.
    - Adjectives end in **-i**, ex. **novi** = new.
    - Adverbs end in **-o**, ex. **novo** = newly.
    - Active verbs end in **-a**, ex. **me loga** = I speak.
    - Passive verbs end in **-u**, ex. **le logu** = It is spoken.
    - Nouns end in **-e**, **-ia** or a consonant.
4. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
5. Adjectives come before the word that they modify.
   All adjectives, except the most common few, end in **-i**.
    - ex. **rapidi loge** = Fast speech.
6. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs and complete sentences.
   They come before the word that they modify or very last in the sentence.
   All adverbs, except the most common few, end in **-o**.
    - ex. 1. **vero rapidi loge** = Very fast speech.
    - ex. 2. **te loga bono.** = You talk well.
7. The verb ending **-a** indicates that the verb is active
   and the agent of the action is immediately before the verb.
    - ex. **me yama aple.** = I eat apples.
8. The verb ending -u indicates that the verb is passive
   and the recipient of the action is immediately before the verb.
    - ex. **aple yamu.** = Apples are eaten.
9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb
   functions as the subject of the next verb.
    - ex. **me cinga te dona pes.** = I ask you to give money.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **me suala te baxa pandunia?** → **suala te baxa pandunia?** = Do
      you speak Pandunia?
    - **me cinga te loga klaro.** →  **cinga loga klaro.**
      = Please speak clearly.
11. Compound words are created by putting the word stems side by side.
    The linking vowel **-o-** is inserted between the stems.
    - ex. **hur-** (freedom) + **ist-** (proponent) → **huriste** (liberalist)
    - ex. **post-** (mail) + **sanduk-** (box) → **postosanduke** (mailbox)

## Pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

### Personal pronouns

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **me**      | **mes**      |
| I, me       | we           |
| **te**      | **tes**      |
| you         | you all      |
| **le**      | **les**      |
| he or she   | they         |

All pronouns can be used for all genders.
The most common third person pronoun is **le**
but also **ye** (_this_) and **ve** (_that_) can be used instead.

The possessive pronouns are:

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi**      | **mesi**     |
| my          | our          |
| **ti**      | **tesi**     |
| your        | your         |
| **li**      | **lesi**     |
| his or her  | their        |


### Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**se**
– self

Note! The same reflexive pronoun is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**me vida se**
– I see myself.  
**le vida se**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mes vida se.**
– We see ourselves.

### Reciprocal pronoun

The word **unale** is used as the reciprocal pronoun.

**unale**
– each other, one another

**me e te vida unale.**
– Me and you see each other.  
**mes vida unale.**
– We see each other.


### Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns are:

**ye** / **yi**
– this  
**ve** / **vi**
– that  
**le** / **li**
– it, the aforementioned

The form that ends in **-e** is used when the demonstrative stands alone,
and the form that ends in **-i** is used when the demonstrative modifies a noun.

The proximal demonstrative **ye** points to things that are near the speaker.
The distal demonstrative **ve** points to things that are far from the speaker.

**ye sa boni.**
– This is good.  
**ve sa dusi.**
– That is bad.  
**me vola yi buke, no vi.**
– I want this book, not that.

The basic proximal and distal pronouns are used for introducing a new object.
The topical demonstrative **le**, on the other hand,
does not specify physical distance
but it is used when the speaker has already mentioned the object or person in question
and it is known by the audience or is topical within the discourse.

**ye sa mau. le vola yama vi mux.**
– This is a cat. It wants to eat that mouse.

**me mala un mau e un vaf. li vaf sa dayi. le yama polo yam.**
– I own a cat and a dog. The dog is big. It eats a lot of food.


#### Abstract use

The demonstrative pronouns can be used also discourse internally.
Then they refer to abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects.
**le** refers to things previously spoken,
**ye** refers to things currently being spoken,
and **ve** refers to things about to be spoken.

**yi jumle sa korti.**
– This sentence is short.

In the above, **yi jumle** (_this sentence_) refers to the sentence being spoken.

**me mena ve: me ama te.**
– I mean this: I love you. OR I mean that I love you.  
**me ama te. le me mena.**
– I love you. That is what I mean.

In the above, the pronoun **ve** refers to the content of the next statement
and **de** refers to the content of the previous statement.


### Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ky**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ky xei?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ky jen?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ky zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  

The adverbial interrogative pronoun is **ko**
and it means the same as English _how_.

Also adjectives are questioned with **ko**.

**ko novi?**
– How new?  
**ko kosti?**
– How costy?  
**ko poli?**
– How many?  
**ko dayi?**
– How big?  
**ko lili?**
– How small?

**te tena ko dayi mau?**
– How big cat do you have?


### Nouns

#### Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing.
Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant.
So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

**seke**
– a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
**meze**
– a table, tables, the table or the tables  
**kurse**
– a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
**sui**
– water

Number and definiteness are often known because they were specified earlier in the discussion or because they are general knowledge.
For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **lun** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and moon.

#### Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in singular and plural.
Number can be mentioned with number words when it is needed.

**kurse**
– a chair or chairs  
**un kurse**
– one chair  
**duli kurse**
– two chairs  
**sani kurse**
– three chairs  
**poli kurse**
– many chairs; chairs


#### Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine and/or neuter categories).

Some words have _natural gender_.
For example **fem** (woman) is feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.

## Adjectives

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to another word,
for example good, bad, big, and fast.

### Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun.
In Midi Pandunia, adjectives end in **-i** and their place is before a noun.

**novi kar**
– new car(s)  
**rapidi kar**
– fast car(s)  
**dayi meze**
– big table(s)  
**gavi meze**
– high table(s)  
**boni kurse**
– good chair(s)

Two or more adjectives can modify the same word.

**lili novi kar**
– a little, new car

Adjective can be also after the noun.
Often this type of phrases can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

**kar novi.**
– The car is new.  
**bagre rapidi.**
– The tiger is fast.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

**novi kar rapidi.**
– The new car is fast.

## Adverbs

### Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Midi Pandunia adverbs end in **-o** and their place is before a verb
or at the end of the sentence.

**me _bono_ sona.**
– I well sleep.  
**me sona _bono_.**
– I sleep _well_.  
**te baxa pandunia _bono_.**
– You speak Pandunia _well_.

### Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier.
For example **day** (big) and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

**dayi jen**
– a big person  
**lili jen**
– a little person  
**sundari jen**
– a beautiful person

**dayo sundari jen**
– very beautiful person  
**lilo sundari jen**
– somewhat beautiful person


### Comparison

Modifiers can be compared with the adverbs of comparison.

- **max**
  (_more_) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim**
  (_most_) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min**
  (_less_) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim**
  (_least_) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **paro**
  (_as_ or _equally_) indicates the comparison of equality

The particle
**ka**
relates the adverbs of comparison to the object of comparison.

**aple sa max boni ka oranje.**
= Apples are better than oranges.  
**oranje sa min boni ka aple.**
= Oranges are less good than apples.  
**te loga paro bono ka me.**
= You speak as well as me.

It is also possible to compare modifiers with the following verbs,
which are directly attached to the object of comparison.

- **maxu**
  (_to exceed_)
- **minu**
  (_to subceed_)
- **paru**
  (_to equal_)

**aple sa boni maxu oranje.**
– Apples are good, exceed oranges. _meaning:_ Apples are better than oranges.  
**oranje sa boni minu aple.**
– Oranges are good, subceed apples. _meaning:_ Oranges are less good than apples.  
**te loga bono para me.**
– You speak well, equal me. _meaning:_ You speak as well as me.


### Adverbs of time and space

Adverbs are used for expressing time and place of events and actions.
Here are some of the most frequently used adverbs:

**ceno**
– before, earlier  
**medo**
– between  
**bado**
– after, later  
**viso**
– instead  
**duro**
– in the meanwhile  
**diko**
– toward  
**sabo**
– because  
**kontro**
– against  
**maxo**
– additionally  

A complement can be added with the preposition **da**.

**me vida les ceno.**
– I have seen them before.  
**me vida les ceno da unyom.**
– I have seen them before Monday.

**me vola xopa tougar maxo da motogar.**
– I want to buy a trailer in addition to the car.

## Numerals

### Cardinal numbers

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words.
They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

**un xing**
– one star  
**duli xing**
– two stars  
**sani xing**
– three stars  
**xavi xing**
– few stars  
**poli xing**
– many stars

**un day kurse**
– one big chair  
**duli day kurse**
– two big chairs  
**sani bon kurse**
– three good chairs

The basic number words are:

- 0 **siri**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **duli**
- 3 **sani**
- 4 **cari**
- 5 **limi**
- 6 **sisi**
- 7 **ceti**
- 8 **bati**
- 9 **novi**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another –
exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nol** or **desi**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un duli**
- 13 **un sani**
- 20 **duli nol**
- 21 **duli un**
- 22 **duli duli**
- 100 **un nol nol** or **honi**
- 101 **un nol un** or **honi un**
- 200 **duli nol nol** or **duli honi**

Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units.
So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1 000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    
Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about.
For example, the word **sol** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.


### Fractions

Fractions are formed with the help of
**fen**
(fraction, part).

**uni dulfen**
– a half, ½  
**uni carfen**
– a quarter, ¼  
**sani carfen**
– three quarters, ¾


### Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers are created with the suffix **-odi**.

- **unodi**
  – first
- **dulodi**
  – second
- **sanodi**
  – third
- **carodi**
  – fourth
- **limodi**
  – fifth
- **sisodi**
  – sixth
- **cetodi**
  – seventh
- **batodi**
  – eighth
- **novodi**
  – ninth
- **desodi**
  – tenth

They are placed before the modified noun like normal adjectives.

**unodi fen**
– the first part  
**dulodi fen**
– the second part  
**sanodi fen**
– the third part


### Date and time

##### Days of the week

In naming the days of the week, a number indicating the day (starting from Monday) is followed by
**yom**
which means the period of 24 hours.
So 'Monday' is literally 'one-day', 'Tuesday' is 'two-day', 'Wednesday' is 'three-day', etc.

1. **unyom**
   – Monday
2. **dulyom**
   – Tuesday
3. **sanyom**
   – Wednesday
4. **caryom**
   – Thursday
5. **limyom**
   – Friday
6. **sisyom**

### Participles

**-an-**
denotes someone or something that does the action of the root.
It is the active participle suffix.

**loga**
– to speak  
**logani**
– speaking  
**logane**
– the one who speaks

**-it-**
denotes someone or something that undergoes the action of the root.
It is the passive participle suffix.

**loga**
– to speak  
**logiti**
– spoken  
**padu**
– to fall  
**paditi**
– fallen  
**una**
to unite
→ **uniti**

#### Causative verbs

The causatives are the verbs that are used to indicate
that one person causes another person to do something.
It can be by asking, paying, requesting, or forcing the person.

Sometimes the simple active verb is causative.

**Tomas pada Yusef.**
– Thomas drops Yusef.  
**Yusef padu.**
– Yusef falls.

In other situations, the causative is formed by using one of the participle suffixes.
**-ana** means that someone causes someone to do something.
**-ita** means that someone causes something to be done to someone or something.

**Sara padana Tomas.**
– Sara causes Thomas to drop (something).  
**Sara padita Yusef.**
– Sara causes Yusef to be dropped.

Here is a more complete example.
Note that "to feed" has two different causative meanings in English.

**pex yamu.**
– Fish is eaten.  
**mau yama pex.**
– The cat eats fish.  
**me yamita pex ga mau.**
– I feed fish to the cat.  
**me yamana mau va pex.**
– I feed the cat with fish.

A causative can imply that the action is done for the causer.

**me no bina dom. me binita le.**
– I don't build the house. I have it built (for myself).


### Prepositions

In Pandunia, prepositions are basically a sub-category of verbs.

#### Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has five prepositions of place and time.

1. **ya** - presence or togetherness:
   with, by use of
2. **na** - absence or lack: without
3. **va** - location or moment (in general):
   at, in, on, by
4. **za** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
5. **ga** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase
the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

**me va hotel.**
– I'm in the hotel.  
**me sona va hotel.**
– I sleep in the hotel.  
**me sona za xam ga sube.**
– I sleep since evening until morning.  
**me safara za London ga Paris.**
– I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they
refer to time.

**me denga za te kita.**
– I have waited since you left.  
**me denga ga te laya dom.**
– I wait until you come home.  
**me denga va te sona.**
– I wait while you sleep.  

##### va

**va** is an all-purpose locative preposition.
Its basic meaning is "at".
 
**me liba va dome.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**me loga va pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**me loga ya doste va pandunia va fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia by telephone.

##### Verbs as prepositions

In Pandunia some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

**me kata pang.**
– I cut bread.  
**me kata pang, uza chake.**
– I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

**me denga dura dul hor.** - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

**bada** - to follow; after, behind  
**dura** - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
**jungu** - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
**loka** - to occupy, to be located; at  
**sirka** - to surround; around  
**supra** - to surpass; over, above  

##### Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In
many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

**me laya dome.**
– I come home.  
**te sida kurse.**
– You sit (on) the chair.  
**le lala sofa.**
– S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
**pex nata daria.**
– Fish swim (in) the sea.  
**jenger marca dau.**
– Warriors march (on) the road.  

#### Preposition of relation

Preposition **ka** indicates the way something is done.
It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

**me sava pandunia ka master.**
– I know Pandunia like a master.

**ka**
relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison.
In the above example
**sava**
(know) is the verb and
**master**
(master) is the point of comparison.

**ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

**pute sa min dayi ko pape.**
– The child is smaller than the father.  
**laupape sa samo dayi ka pape.**
– Grandfather is as big as father.

**ka** relates the adverbs of comparison
– **max** (more), **min** (less) and **samo** (same) –
to the point of comparison, which is **pape** (father) in the examples above.

## Sentences

### Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type.
They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention.

**mau!**
– A cat!  
**barxa!**
– (It) rains!

### Stative Sentences

#### With noun or pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate.
In the simplest sentences, the subject is a noun or a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

**me boni.**
– I am good.  
**le novi.**
– It is new.  
**le Sara.**
– She is Sara.  
**Sara boni.**
– Sara is good.  
**petre dayi.**
– The stone is big.  
**meze novi.**
– The table is new.  

The word **no** is added to form the negative.

**me no boni.**
– I'm not good.  
**le no novi.**
– It's not new.  
**le no Sara.**
– She is not Sara.

It is possible to add the word **sa** (to be) before the predicate in positive sentences,
for style or for convenience.
Then the structure is similar like in negative sentences.

**Sara sa boni.**
– Sara is good.  
**petre sa dayi.**
– The stone is big.  
**meze sa novi.**
– The table is new.  
**meze no purani.**
– The table is not old.

Also two personal pronouns can be combined with **si** and **no**.

**me sa le.**
– I am he/she.  
**me no sa te.**
– I'm not you.

#### With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

**jovani sa sundari.**
– Young is beautiful.  
**novi no sa purani.**
– New is not old.  

#### With verb subject

A verb can't be subject as such.
So the verb is first, use **de** to start a comment about the verb.

**canta, de sa boni.**
– Singing, that is good. (Singing is good.)


### Active Sentences

An active sentence is a sentence where the subject does the action denoted by the verb to the object.
The focus is on the subject as the active participant.
The correct word order is subject-verb-object (SVO).

In Midi Pandunia, active verbs are easy to identify because all of them end in **-a**.


The following sentences are in SVO order.

**me yama aple.**
– I eat apples.  
**me vida te.**
– I see you.


### Passive Sentences

In the passive voice the focus of the sentence is on a subject
that is a passive recipient that undergoes the action.
So the recipient is the subject of the sentence.
Often the agent is not mentioned at all.

In Midi Pandunia, the passive voice is expressed with the verb ending in **-u**.
The word order is subject–verb–(optional object) or, more precisely,
recipient–verb–(optional agent).

**te vidu.**
– You are seen.  
**musike audu.**
– Music is heard.  
**pang beku.**
– Bread is baked.  
**kope parcu.**
– Cup breaks. (Cup gets broken.)

The agent can be mentioned after the verb with or without the preposition **da**.

**te vidu me.** - You are seen by me.  
**te vidu da me.** - You are seen by me.

Sometimes a passive verb can be translated with an active verb in English.
That is sometimes the case with **suku**, which means _to be pleased by_ (a passive verb) or _to like_ (an active verb).
That is because the direction of pleasing is from the active doer to the passive recipient.

**me suku musike.**
– I am pleased by music. / I like music.


### Pivot structure

#### Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  
subject – verb 1 – object 1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 has two roles.
It is at the same time the object for the verb 1 and the subject for the verb 2.

**me vola te yama vejete.**
– I want you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **me vola** has **te** as its object.
At the same time, **te** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **yama vejete**.
So **te** is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.

The first verb in a pivot structure is a modal verb,
which indicates a modality such as advice, desire, permission or obligation.

**me vola te yama vejete.**
– I want you to eat vegetables. (desire)  
**me sela te yama vejete.**
– I advice you to eat vegetables. (advice)  
**me halala te yama vejete.**
– I allow you to eat vegetables. (permission)  
**me musa te yama vejete.**
– I compel you to eat vegetables. (obligation)  


### Verb series structure

There can be two, three or even more verbs in a series,
and all of them are about the same subject.
 
1. **me gova dom.**
   – I go home.  
2. **me abla gova dom.**
   – I can go home.  
3. **me vola abla gova dom.**
   – I want to be able to go home.
   (Word for word: _I want can go home_!)

The last verb in the series is the main verb.
The verbs before it are modal verbs,
which that indicate a modality such as likelihood, ability, advice, permission, desire, or obligation.

**te abla yama vejete.**
– You can eat vegetables. (ability)  
**te selu yama vejete.**
– You had better eat vegetables. (advice)  
**te halalu yama vejete.**
– You may eat vegetables. (permission)  
**te vola yama vejete.**
– You want to eat vegetables. (desire)  
**te musu yama vejete.**
– You must eat vegetables. (obligation)  

### Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity.
This is done especially in commands and requests.

#### Short pivot structure (VOVO)

**me suala te baxa pandunia.**
– I ask do you speak Pandunia.  
**suala te baxa pandunia?**
– Do you speak Pandunia.

#### Short pivot structure (VVO)

**me cinga te laya dom.**
– I ask you to come home.  
**cinga laya dom!**
– Please come home!
(Word for word: _Request come home!_)


### Relative clauses

A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun phrase, most commonly a noun.
For example, the phrase "the person who lives there" containst the noun _person_,
which is modified by the relative clause _who lives there_.

There are different ways to build a relative clause in Pandunia.
The relative pronoun in Pandunia is **de**
and it corresponds to English _that_, _who_ and _which_.

The relativized word can be emphasized by **di**,
as in the following example,
but it is necessary only in complex phrases.

In Pandunia, relative clauses are always set off by commas.

**di buke, de jen kitaba, padu.**
– _That_ book, which the person writes, falls.

Normally the same sentence includes only **de**.

**buke, de jen kitaba, padu.**
– The book that the person writes falls.

It is possible to leave also **de** out.
This structure is called _reduced relative clause_.

**buke, jen kitaba, padu.**
– The book the person writes falls.

The relative pronoun is necessary
when the relativized noun is the subject of the relative clause.

**jen, de kitaba buke, padu.**
– The person that writes the book falls.

Also the object noun of a preposition can be the target of the relative clause.
It's possible to use relative pronouns or the reduced relative clause structure.

**_di_ kalam, ya _de_ jen kitaba buke, padu.**
– _That_ pen, with _which_ the person writes the book, falls.  
**kalam, jen kitaba buke ya, padu.**
– The pen the person writes the book with falls.

The relative pronoun can be put in its right place in the pivot structure
or it can be left out by using the reduced relative clause structure.

**_di_ jen, me vida _de_ kitaba buke, padu.**
– The person, whom I see write the book, falls.  
**jen, me vida kitaba buke, padu.**
– The person that I see write the book falls.  

Also _resumptive relative pronoun_ can be used if needed.

**_di_ jen, me kitaba buke ya _de_ du kalam, padu.**
– The person whose pen I write the book with falls.  

Finally, a content clause can also involve **de**,
which refers back to the previous phrase.

**jen kitaba buke, de sa hami.**
– The person writes a book, which is important.

However, it is unclear whethere **de** (_which_) refers to only the book
or the fact that the person writes the book.
It can be clarified by an expression like
**di fate**
(_the fact_).

**jen kitaba buke, di fate sa hami.**
– The fact that the person writes the book is important.


### Combining phrases with conjunctions

#### Basic conjunctions

1. **e** and (connects two similar words or phrases)
2. **o** or (connects two alternative words or phrases)
3. **a** - but (introduces a word or phrase that contrasts with or
   contradicts the preceding word or phrase)

**me suku mau e vaf.**
– I like cats and dogs.  
**me suku mau o vaf.**
– I like cats or dogs.  
**me suku mau a no vaf.**
– I like cats but not dogs.

### Particles

#### Affirmation and Negation

##### Affirmative

Expressions are affirmative by default.

**me sa xef.**
– I am the boss.  
**le sa novi meze.**
– It is a new table.

Affirmation can be emphasized with the adverb
**yo**
(_indeed_).

**me yo sa xef.**
– I indeed am the boss.  
**le yo sa novi meze.**
– It indeed is a new table.

##### Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

**le no sa xef.**
– He is not the boss.  
**le no sa novi meze.**
– It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything.
It affects always the next word.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location of the negative word.

**me vida te.**
– I see you.  
**me no vida te.**
– I don't see you.  
**me vida no te a les.**
– I see, not you, but them.

**me cinga te safa kamar.**
– I ask you to clean the room.  
**me no cinga te safa kamar.**
– I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**me cinga te no safa kamar.**
– I ask you NOT to clean the room.

Words
**ye**
(_yes_) and
**no**
(_no_) are used for answering questions.

**suala te vida me?**
– Do you see me?  
**ye. (me yo vida te.)**
– Yes. (I indeed see you.)  
**no. (me no vida te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)

Negative questions are answered so that
**ye**
and
**no**
apply to the verb, not the whole question.

**suala te no vida me?**
– Don't you see me?  
**ye. (me vida te.)**
– Yes. (I see you.)  
**no. (me no vida te.)**
– No. (I don't see you.)


#### Modifier particles

Particles **du** and **da** are used to link a noun, an adjective or a verb phrase to a noun to modify it.
**du** connects the modifying word or phrase to the main noun word.
**da** works in the opposite direction, it connects the main noun to the modifying word or phrase.

##### Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **du** works like the apostrophe-s ('s) in English.
It indicates that the previous word has possession of the next one.

**Maria du mam**
– Maria's mother  
**Maria du mam du dom**
– Maria's mother's house

**da** works like "of" in English.
It indicates that the next word has possession of the previous one.

**mam da Maria**
– the mother of Maria  
**dom da mam da Maria**
– the house of the mother of Maria

It's possible to use **da** and **du** with personal pronouns too,
so one can say things like
**dom da me** (_the house of mine_)
but it's better to use the short possessive pronouns and say simply
**mi dom** (_my house_).

##### Modification with noun phrases

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun.
It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

**rozi rang du labe**
– rose-colored lips  
**samani rang du oke**
– sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

**labe da rozi rang**
– lips of the rose-color  
**oke da samani rang**
– eyes of the sky-color

The particles help in creating measure words too.
 
**un sake du patate**
– one sack of potatoes  
**dul sake du patate**
– two sacks of potatoes  
**max sake du patate**
– more sacks of potatoes

Note that **du** and **da** connect phrases together.
So a modifier phrase with and without **du** can mean a different thing.

**max sundari fule**
– more beautiful flowers  
**max du sundari fule**
– more of beautiful flowers

##### Modification with verb phrases

Verbs and verb phrases are turned into modifiers by placing **da** or **du** immediately next to the verb.

**arte da penta graf**
– the art of painting pictures  
**suke da helpa ale**
– the joy of helping others


#### Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed.
The general time words are **ceno** (past), **zayo** (present) and **poso** (future, upcoming).
They function like adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb.

**me ceno ha mau.**
– I had cats.  
**a me no zayo ha mau.**
– But I now don't have cats.  
**ablo me poso ha mau.**
– Maybe I will have cats.

It's also possible to say it in a longer way like **ya censate** (in the past) etc.

**me ha mau ya censate.**
– I had cats in the past.  
**a me no ha mau ya zaisate.**
– But I don't have cats at present.  
**ablo me ha mau ya pososate.**
– Maybe I will have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated.
So the verb **ha** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary.
Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text
and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.
