Grammar

## 0. Introduction

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in Pandunia. However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading this grammar, for example with the help of a phrasebook and a dictionary.

All language teachers know that a language becomes more difficult to learn when the student must learn to make distinctions that he is not used to making. That's why students have difficulties with things like irregular spelling, case-inflection, mandatory tenses, tones, noun/adjective agreement, honorific inflection, consonant and vowel harmony, mandatory gender distinctions and so on.

Pandunia is not a difficult language to learn. It doesn't have any of the previously mentioned complexities. Instead, it has a simple grammar, a relatively simple vocabulary, and a simple phonetic spelling.

One thing to keep in mind as you learn Pandunia is that it is not a strict, rule-oriented language where there is a "right way" and a "wrong way" to say things. The important thing is to make yourself understood. Consequently, much of the language involves the lexical items (words that have meaning, like "book" or "eat"), and very little involves purely grammatical ideas (like singular vs. plural and tenses).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## 1. The basic rules

These are the 11 basic rules of Pandunia language.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2. The stress is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
4. The adjectives and the adverb have the same form. They come before the word that they modify. Frequently adjectives end in **-i**.
    - ex. 1. **bon pang** = Good bread.
    - ex. 2. **tu bon loga.** = You speak well.
5. Compound words are formed by putting words side by side.
    - ex. **poste sanduke** = mailbox
6. Verbs that end in -a indicate subject-verb-object word order.
    - ex. **mi nyama pang.** = I eat bread.
7. Verbs that end in -u indicate object-verb-subject word order.
    - ex. **pang nyamu.** = The bread is eaten.
8. The verbs do not change for person or number.
9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb functions as the subject of the next verb.
    - ex. **mi cing tu dona mone.** = I ask you to give money.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **mi kia tu baxa pandunia?** → **kia tu baxa pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
    - **mi cing tu loga ming.** →  **cing loga ming.** = Please speak clearly.
11. Derived words carry an optional ending. Adjectives end in -i, nouns end in -e, and verbs end in -a or -u.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Nouns

### 2.1. Uninflected

A noun is a word that names a thing. Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant. So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

> **batu'** - a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
> **meza'** - a table, tables, the table or the tables  
> **kurse** - a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
> **suy** - water

Quite often number and definiteness is known because it was specified earlier or because it is general knowledge. For example, normally the word **surya** refers to _the sun_ and **luna** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and our only moon.

### 2.2. Number

Nouns are unaffected by number, i.e. nouns have the same form in singular and plural.

An easy way to emphasize plurality is to repeat the noun.

> **batu' batu'** - stones, lots of stones  
> **tara' tara'** - stars, lots of stars  

### 2.3. Gender

Pandunia doesn't have grammatical gender (i.e. masculine, feminine and/or neuter categories).

Some words carry _natural gender_. For example **fem** (woman) is feminine and **man** (man) is masculine.

### 2.4. Compounds

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word. The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

> **surya guang** - sunlight  
> **luna guang** - moonlight  
> **luna batu'** - moonstone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds some quality or description to the thing denoted by another word, ex. good, bad, big, fast.

### 3.1. Modifying a noun

An adjective is a word that adds a particular quality for a noun. In Pandunia an adjective is a modifier that is before a noun.

> **day batu'** - big stone
> **day meza'** - big table  
> **gaw meza'** - high table
> **bon kurse** - good chair

When adjective can be also after the noun. Often this type of phrases can be read as complete sentences, where the verb _to be_ is implied.

> **batu' day.** - The stone is big.  
> **meza' gaw.** - The table is high.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

> **day meza' gaw.** - Big table is high.


### 3.2 Modifying a verb

An adverb is a word that modifies a verb or another modifier.

In Pandunia an adverb is a modifier that is before a verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **mi _bon_ sona.** - I well sleep.  
> **mi sona _bon_.** - I sleep _well_.  
> **tu baxa pandunia _bon_.** - You speak Pandunia _well_.


### 3.4 Modifying another modifier

A modifier can modify also another modifier. For example **day** (big) and **lil** (little) can be used as intensifying adverbs.

> **day ren** - big person  
> **lil ren** - little person  
> **sundar ren** - beautiful person

> **day sundar ren** - very beautiful person  
> **lil sundar ren** - somewhat beautiful person

The modifiers can be separated by using **i** (and).

> **lil i sundar ren** - a little and beautiful person


### 3.5. Comparison

Modifiers can be compared.

- **max** (more) indicates comparison of superiority
- **maxim** (most) indicates the superlative of superiority
- **min** (less) indicates comparison of inferiority
- **minim** (least) indicates the superlative of inferiority
- **sem** (as) indicates the comparison of equality

Particle **ka** relates the adverbs of comparison to the point of comparison.

> **mi si max bon ka tu.** - I am better than you.  
> **tu loga sem bon ka mi.** - You speak as well as mi.


#### 3.6. Modifier ending

Adjectives end in **-i** by default. The ending is used always with words that are derived from action roots and thing roots. Ex. **logi** _spoken_, **suki** _pleasant_, **kitabi** _written_.

The ending is not applied to description roots that end in a single consonant that is easy to pronounce. Ex. **bon** _good_, **sundar** _beautiful_.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Numerals

Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about. For example, the word **surya** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words. They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

> **un tara'** - one star  
> **do tara'** - two stars  
> **sam tara'** - three stars  
> **xaw tara'** - few stars
> **poli tara'** - several stars (two or more)  
> **multi tara'** - many stars

> **un day meza'** - one big table  
> **do day kurse** - two big chairs  
> **sam bon kurse** - three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

> **fen un** - the first part (part one)
> **fen do** - the second part (part two)
> **fen sam** - the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nul**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **do**
- 3 **sam**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **set**
- 8 **bat**
- 9 **noy**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another – exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nul** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un do**
- 13 **un sam**
- 20 **do nul**
- 21 **do un**
- 22 **do do**
- 100 **un nul nul** or **hon**
- 101 **un nul un** or **hon un**
- 200 **do nul nul** or **do hon**


Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units. So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    


## 5. Pronouns

### 5.1. Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute thing-words and phrases of thing-words.

**mi** - I, mi  
**tu** - you  
**ye** - he, she, it  
**mimen** - we  
**tumen** - you all  
**yemen** - they

**se** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons, so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi wida se** - I see myself.  
**ye wida se** - She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mimen wida se.** - We see ourselves.  


### 5.2. Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns are:

**ce** - this one  
**le** - that one  

> **mi wola ce.** - I want this one.

They end in **-i** when they function as adjectives i.e. when they come before a noun.

> **ci maw** - This cat  
> **li maw.** - That cat  


### 5.3. Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun. It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

> **ke?** - Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ki** and it meanst the same as English _which_.

> **ki xey?** - What? (Which thing?)  
> **ki ren?** - Who? (Which person?)  
> **ki zaman?** - When? (What time?)  
> **ki yang?** - How? (What manner?)  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Verbs

#### 6.1. General

A verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.

Pandunia has two types of verb: verbs that end in **-a** and verbs that end in **-u**. The endings decide the order of the other constituents (subject and object) in the sentence. So the sentence structure depends on the type of the verb.

#### 6.2. Verbs that end in -a

Verbs that end in **-a** use this triangular pattern.

    Word order triangle for verbs that end in -a
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    S ← O

#### 6.2.1. SVO order

The most common word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object (SVO). In this sentence structure the subject comes first, the verb second, and the object third.

    subject-verb-object
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    S   O

Examples:  
**mi wida yemen.** - I see them.  
**tu beka pang.** - You bake bread.  

#### 6.2.2. OSV order

The second structure in this triangle is OSV. It is frequent in dependant clauses.

    object-subject-verb
    
      V
     ↗ 
    S ← O

Examples:  
**ke tu wida?** - What do you see?  
**mi nyama pang, jo tu beka.** - I eat bread _that you baked._

#### 6.2.3. VOS order

The third structure of this triangle is VOS, which is rarely used.

    verb-object-subject
    
      V
       ↘
    S ← O



#### 6.3. Verbs that end in -u

Verbs that end in **-u** use this triangular pattern.

    Word order triangle for verbs that end in -u
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    O ← S

#### 6.3.1. SOV order

SOV order is commonly used alternative for SVO order.

    subject-object-verb
    
      V
     ↗ 
    O ← S

Examples:  
**mi yemen widu.** - _I them see._  
**tu pang beku.** - _You bread bake._

#### 6.3.2. OVS order

OVS order is common in "passive" sentences.

    object-verb-subject
    
      V
     ↗ ↘
    O   S

Examples:  
**pang beku tu.** - Bread is baked by you.  
**tu suku mi.** - You are pleased by me.

#### 6.3.3. VSO order

VSO order is very rare but possible.

    verb-subject-object
    
      V
       ↘
    O ← S

### 6.3. Passive sentences

In passive sentence there is only object and verb but no subject (i.e. agent).

> **mi widu.** - I am seen.  
> **pang beku.** - Bread is baked.  
> **kupe kaputu.** - Cup breaks. (Cup gets broken.)

### 6.4. Verb endings

Most verbs end in **-a** and **-u**. A handful of verbs are without a standard ending.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Sentences

### 8.1. Observations

Observations are the simplest sentence type. They may consist of only one word, which draws the listener's attention to it.

> **maw!** - A cat!  
> **pluva!** - (It) rains!  


### 7.2. Stative Sentences


#### 7.2.1. With pronoun subject

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. In the simplest sentences, the subject is a personal pronoun and the predicate is an adjective or a noun.

> **mi bon.** - I am good.  
> **ye nowi.** - It is new.  
> **ye sara.** - She is Sara.  

The word **no** is added to form the negative.

> **mi no bon.** - I'm not good.  
> **ye no nowi.** - It's not new.  
> **ye no sara.** - She is not Sara.

Also two personal pronouns can be juxtaposed.

> **mi si ye.** - I am he/she.  
> **mi no tu.** - I'm not you.

#### 7.2.2. With noun subject

When the subject is a noun, the word **si** (yes) is added before the predicate in positive sentences. The negative sentences use **no** like above.

> **sara si bon.** - Sara is good.  
> **batu si day.** - The stone is big.  
> **meza si nowi.** - The table is new.  
> **meza no law.** - The table is not old.


#### 7.2.3. With adjective subject

The same rule applies also for two adjectives.

> **jowan si sundar.** - Young is beautiful.  
> **nowi no law.** - New is not old.  

#### 7.2.4. To be

Pandunia doesn't use a verb like "to be" in English.



### 7.3. Active Sentences

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is a verb (i.e. an action-word). In Pandunia, verbs are easy to identify because most of them end in **-a** or **-u**.

Active sentences that use a verb ending in **-a** have the subject–verb–object word order (SVO).

> **mi nyama apel.** - I eat apples.  
> **mi auda musike.** - I hear music.  
> **mi wida tu.** - I see you.

Verbs ending in **-u** are used in the subject–object–verb word order (SOV).

**mi apel nyamu.** - _I apples eat._

SOV and SVO are the two most common word orders by far in the languages of the world. SOV is used in languages like Hindi-Urdu, Tamil, Turkish, Japanese and Korean. SVO is used in English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Indonesian and Modern Arabic among others.


### 7.4. Passive Sentences

#### 7.4.1. OV order

In the passive voice there is no agent subject in the sentence. There is only the object and the verb. Normally the passive is expressed with object–verb (VO) word order with the verb ending in **-u**.

> **tu widu.** - You are seen.  
> **musike audu.** - Music is heard.  
> **pang beku.** - Bread is baked.  

Here the focus is on the object, which is the first word in the sentence. The object is a passive actor that undergoes the action.

The agent can be mentioned after the verb with or without the preposition **du**.

> **tu widu mi.** - You are seen by me.  
> **tu widu du mi.** - You are seen by me.


#### 7.4.2. OV order

In verb–object (VO) order the focus is on the verb.

> **wida tu.** - Seeing you.  
> **auda musike.** - Listening music.  
> **beka pang.** - Baking bread.


#### 7.5. All Possible Word Orders

There are six possible word orders for the transitive sentence. In practice, all of them are possible in Pandunia. They are made possible by the two verb endings, which decide the order of the other constituents (subject and object).

Different orders put the focus on different constituents: the subject, the object or the verb. The focus or emphasis is on the first part of a sentence.

    1. With the verb ending in -a
        - object–subject–verb (OSV) : musike mi auda.
        - subject–verb–object (SVO) :        mi auda musike.
        - verb–object–subject (VOS) :           auda musike mi.
    2. With the verb ending in -u
        - subject-object-verb (SOV) : mi musike audu.
        - object-verb-subject (OVS) :    musike audu mi.
        - verb-subject-object (VSO) :           audu mi musike.

The constituent, which is further away from the verb, can be left out. So for example **musike mi auda** (OSV) can be truncated to **mi auda** (SV). Likewise **mi musike audu** (SOV) can be truncated to **musike audu** (OV).

The typical word orders in everyday Pandunia are SVO, SOV and OSV. The other word orders can be heard in poetry and in other forms of literary language.


### 7.6. Pivot structure

#### 7.6.1. Basic pivot structure (SVOVO)

In the _pivot structure_ the word order is:  
subject – verb 1 – object 1 – verb 2 – object 2.

Object 1 functions has dual role. It is at the same time the object for verb 1 and the subject for verb 2.

> **mi wol tu nyama sabze.** - I want you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **mi wol** has **tu** as its object. At the same time, **tu** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **nyama sabze**. So **tu** is the _pivot_ of the entire sentence.


### 7.7. Serial verbs

All action-words (verbs) that come one after another are activated by the subject. There can be two, three or even more action-words in series.
 
1. **mi enda dom.** - I go home.  
2. **mi ken enda dom.** - I can go home.  
3. **mi wol ken enda dom.** - I want to be able to go home. (Lit. _I want can go home_!)


### 7.8. Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity. This is done especially in commands and requests.

#### 7.8.1. Short pivot structure (VOVO)

> **mi kia tu baxa pandunia.** - I ask do you speak Pandunia.  
> **kia tu baxa pandunia?** - Do you speak Pandunia.

#### 7.8.2. Short pivot structure (VVO)

> **mi cing tu lay dom.** - I ask you to come home.  
> **cing lay dom!** - Please come home! (Literally: _Request come home!_)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Conjunctions

### 8.1. Basic conjunctions

1. **i** and (connects two similar words or phrases)
2. **u** or (connects two alternative words or phrases)
3. **a** - but (introduces a word or phrase that contrasts with or contradicts the preceding word or phrase)

> **mi suku maw i waf.** - I like cats and dogs.  
> **mi suku maw u waf.** - I like cats or dogs.  
> **mi suku maw a no waf.** - I like cats but not dogs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Particles


### 9.1. Affirmation and Negation

### 9.1.1. Affirmative

Particle **si** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **si** affirms the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it. In other words **si** means "to be" or "there is" and **no** means "not to be" or "there is not".

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **si** is not always necessary. However it is especially convenient in expressions of state.

> **mi si ren.** - I am a person.  
> **ye si nowi meza.** - It is a new table.

### 9.1.2. Negative

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

> **mi no ren.** - I'm not a person.  
> **ye no nowi meza.** - It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.

> **mi wida tu.** - I see you.  
> **mi no wida tu.** - I don't see you.  
> **mi wida no tu a yemen.** - I see, not you, but them.

The particles **si** and **no** are used also for answering questions.

> **kia tu wida mi?** - Do you see me?  
> **si. (mi wida tu.)** - Yes. (I see you.)  
> **no. (mi no wida tu.)** - No. (I don't see you.)



### Modifier particles

Particles **da** and **du** are used to mark possession and modification. **da** connects the modifying word or phrase to the modified word. **du** works in the opposite direction. It connects the modified word to the modifier.

#### 9.2.1. Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **da** works like apostrophe-s ('s) in English.

> **maria da mama** - Maria's mother  
> **mi da dom** - my house  
> **mi da papa da dom** - my father's house

**du** works like "of" in English.

> **mama du maria** - the mother of Maria
> **dom du mi** - the house of mine  
> **dom du papa du mi** - the house of the father of mine

#### 9.2.2. Attribution with adjectives

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun. It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

> **roza rang da labe** - rose-colored lips  
> **saman rang da yen** - sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

> **labe du roza rang** - lips of the color of the rose  
> **yen du saman rang** - eyes of the color of the sky

#### 9.2.3. Relative clauses

Also relative clauses are created with help of the modifier particles.

Here **du** has a similar role as English relative pronouns _which_, _that_, _who_ and _whom_.

> **ye si man _du mi wida_.** - He is the man _that I saw_.

If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object (i.e. if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause.

> **mi wida man _du nyama apel_.** - I see a man _who eats apples_.  

It's possible to construct relative clauses with **da** too. Then the relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. The verb is turned into a modifier by putting **da** immediately after the verb.

> **mi wida _apel nyamu da_ man.** - I see an _apple-eating_ man.

> **buke dugu da ren na kamer.** = The book-reading person is in the room.
> **ye duga da buke na meza.** = The book, that he/she reads, is on the table.  


### 9.3. Modal Particles

Modal particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in relation to the listener. Modal particles are commonly used in many languages. East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a modal particle modifies the subsequent word, or the whole sentence, when the modal particle is the last word in the sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions much like in English.

> **ye nyama bir plus.** - S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
> **ye nyama plus bir.** - S/he drinks _also beer_.  
> **ye plus nyama bir.** - S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
> **plus ye nyama bir.** - _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Modal particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.


### 9.4. Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed. The general time words are **pas** (past), **zay** (present) and **futur** (future). They function like adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **mi ada maw pas.** - I had cats in the past.
> **a mi no ada maw zay.** - But I don't have cats now.
> **munkin mi ada maw futur.** - Maybe I have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated. So the verb **ada** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary. Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Prepositions

### 10.1. Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has four prepositions of place and time.

1. **na** - presence, location or moment (in general): with, at, in, on, by, during, while
2. **be** - absence or lack: without
3. **ze** - origin, beginning or cause: from, since, because
4. **to** - destination, end or purpose: to, till, until, for, then

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

> **mi na hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
> **mi sona na hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
> **mi sona ze xam to suba.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
> **mi safara ze london to paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  


Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they refer to time.

> **mi denga ze tu enda.** - I have waited since you left.  
> **mi denga to tu lay dom.** - I wait until you come home.  
> **mi denga na tu sona.** - I wait while you sleep.  

#### 10.1.2. na

**na** is an all-purpose preposition. Its basic meaning is "with".
 
**mi stasa na dom.**  
_I stand with house._  
I stand by the house.
 
**mi loga na pandunia.**  
_I speak with Pandunia._  
I speak in Pandunia.
 
**mi loga na doste na pandunia na fon.**  
_I speak with friends with Pandunia with telephone._  
I speak with friends in Pandunia in telephone.

#### 10.1.3. Verbs as prepositions

In Pandunia some verbs function like prepositions do in English.

> **mi kata pang.** - I cut bread.  
> **mi kata pang, uza caku.** - I cut bread, use a knife. (I cut bread with a knife.)  

> **mi denga dura do hor.** - I wait, (it) lasts two hours. (I wait during/for two hours.)

Here are some verbs that are usable as prepositions:

> **bada** - to follow; after, behind  
> **dura** - to last; during, for the time/duration of  
> **jungu** - to be centered; amid, amidst, in the middle, in the center  
> **loka** - to occupy, to be located; at  
> **sirka** - to surround; around  
> **supra** - to surpass; over, above  
> **karena** - be caused by; because  

#### 10.1.4. Verbs without prepositions

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

> **mi laya dom.** - I come home.  
> **tu sidu kurse.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
> **ye lala sofa.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
> **fixe nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
> **jangar marca daw.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  


### 10.2. Preposition of relation

Prepositions **ka** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

> **mi saba pandunia ka guru.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**ka** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In the above example **saba** (know) is the verb and **guru** (master) is the point of comparison.

**ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

> **bace si min day ka papa.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
> **opa si sem day ka papa.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**ka** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min** (less) and **sem** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is **papa** (father) in the examples above.



## 11. Word Building

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia. Pandunia has a productive system of word derivation. Most of the suffixes that are used in Pandunia are already in international use. Many of hem come from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic and Persian.

### 11.1. Part of speech markers

Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation. In this system the final vowel of a word marks the type of the word. The system applies mainly to those words, which are derived from action-roots and description-roots. Some adjectives are also derived from thing-roots. Pronouns, conjuctions, numerals and particles are outside of the word derivation system.

Pandunia uses the following vowel endings to mark parts of speech.

- **a** marks verbs for subject-verb-object word order (SVO)
- **u** marks verbs for object-verb-subject word order (OVS)
- **i** marks adjectives i.e. modifiers of nouns
- **e** marks nouns that are derived from action roots and description roots

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of word from another. An ending is simply changed to another ending. Here are some examples.

**loga** - to speak (active verb)  
**logu** - to be spoken (passive verb)  
**logi** - spoken, wordy (adjective)  
**loge** or **log** - speech, word(s) (noun)  

**kitaba** - to write (active verb)  
**kitabu** - to be written (passive verb)  
**kitabi** - written, textual (adjective)  
**kitabe** or **kitab** - writing, text (noun)  

**nowi** or **now** - new (adjective)  
**nowa** - to make new (active verb)  
**nowu** - to become new (passive verb)  
**nowe** - novelty, new thing (noun)  

There is a handful of verbs, which appear without the ending. These are some of the most common verbs in Pandunia.

**ada** - to have (active verb)  
**adu** - to belong (passive verb)  
**ade** - that what is had (noun)  

**mus** or **musu** - to must, to be compelled (passive verb)  
**musa** - to compel (active verb)  
**musi** - compulsory, obligatory  


#### 11.1.2. Deriving verbs

Dynamic verbs end in **-a** and **-u**. From the narrow perspective of a phrase that consists of only a subject and a verb, it can be said that **-a** marks an active verb and **-u** marks a passive verb. So **loga** means _to speak_ and **logu** means _to be spoken_.

1. If the root is an action, then its verbal form will mean "to do the action". For example from **wide** = "a look" we get **wida** = "to look".
2. If the root is a description, like **now-** (**nowi** = new), then its verbal form will mean "to turn into that quality". For example from **nowi** = "new" we get **nowa** = "to make new" or "to renew".


#### 11.1.3. Deriving nouns

**-e** is the marker of nouns. It means the result of the process. So **loge** means the _speech_ that results from the act of speaking. Quite often **-e** is left out and so **log** would mean the same thing as **loge**.

If the root word is an action, then its noun form will mean the product of the action. For example from **kitab-** = "to write" we get **kitabe** = "writing" or "text".

If the root word is a description, then its noun form will mean a concrete instance of that quality. For example from **now-** = "new" we get **nowe** = "a novelty" i.e. something new.

Additional noun suffixes are presented below.


#### 11.1.4. Deriving modifiers

**-i** is the marker of adjective and adjectival verb (i.e. static verb). It is the all-purpose adjective suffix.

For example, from the verb **loga** (to speak) we get the adjective **logi** (spoken, wordy). From the noun **manux** (human being), we get the adjective **manuxi** (human, having the attributes of a human being). However, only derived adjectives need to end in **-i**.

Words that are adjectives _by birth_ don't need the ending. That's why for example **bon** (good) and **sundar** (beautiful) don't end in -i.

If the root word is a description, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is in the state of the root". For example from **now-** = quality of novelty, we get **nowi** = _new_ i.e. _that which is new_.

If the root is an action, then its adjectival form will mean the state that is produced by the action. For example from **loga** = "to speak" we get **logi** = "spoken". The corresponding adverb will be **logo** = _in a spoken way_, _orally_.

If the root is a thing, an object or a person, then its adjectival form will mean "that which is like the root".

If the root is a place word, then it's adjectival form will mean "that which is from that place".

**iran** Iran, **irani** Iranian  
**pakistan** Pakistan, **pakistani** Pakistani  
**amerika** America, **amerikai** American  
**europa** Europe, **europai** European  
**asia** Asia, **asiai** Asian

#### 11.1.5. Words without an ending

1. When a thing-root serves as a noun, it doesn't need the noun ending.
2. When a description-root serves as an adjective, it doesn't need the adjective ending.
3. When an action-root serves as a verb, it doesn't always need the verb ending. (*)

|                  | Noun        | Adjective   | Verb        |
|:-----------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|
| Thing-root       | **manux**   | manuxi      | -           |
| Description-root | bone        | **bon**     | bona        |
| Action-root      | wole        | woli        | **wol**     |

Note! Pandunia doesn't follow the rule about action-roots because we think that normally it is more useful to mark verbs than nouns. So an action-root like **kitab** (writing) gives two verbs, **kitaba** and **kitabu** – but the plain root, **kitab**, is used as a noun!


### 11.2. Derivational Suffixes

#### 11.2.1. -er

Creates agent nouns. It denotes a person or a tool who does the action.

**loga** to speak; **loger** speaker, the one who speaks  
**beka** to bake; **beker** baker, the one who bakes  
**lida** to lead; **lider** leader, the one who leads  
**filsofa** to think deeply; **filsofer** philosopher  
**komputa** to compute, to process data; **komputer** computer  
**marta** to kill; **marter** killer  

The derivative can be also more loosely associated with the root.

**sapate** shoe; **sapater** shoemaker  
**muskete** musket; **musketer** musketeer  
**kase** cash desk; **kaser** cashier  


<!--

#### 11.2.2. -ur

Creates patient nouns from action roots. It denotes a person or a thing to whom the action is done.

**kriata** to create; **kriatur** creature, the one who is created  
**marta** to kill; **martur** the one who gets killed; by extension: a martyr  
**folda** to fold; **foldur** folder, something that is folded

-->

#### 11.2.4. -ia

Creates aggregate nouns. It denotes a group of elements named by the root as a whole.

**insan** human being; **insania** humanity, mankind, all the human beings as a group.  
**kristi** Christian, **kristia** Christianity, all Christians as a group.  
**filsof** view, outlook, life wisdom; **filsofia** philosophy, the discipline of wisdom.  

This ending is often found in place names, especially in country names. However this use is not systematic and it's not required. There are also a lot of country names that do not end in **-ia**.

**arabi** Arab, Arabic; **arabia** Arabia  
**rus** Russian; **rusia** Russia  
**turki** Turk, Turkish; **turkia** Turkey  
**asia** Asia  
**indonesia** Indonesia

Also abstract nouns often end in **-ia**.

**nowi** new, **nowia** newness, novelty  

When it is added after -er, it means a place of work.

**bekeria** bakery  
**fakteria** factory  
**sapateria** shoemaker's shop  


#### 11.2.5. -is-

Causative suffix.

**saba** to know  
**sabisa** to make known, to inform  
**nota** to note  
**notisa** to notify

## 12. Advanced Topics

Note: You can learn the language without reading this chapter. But if you're interested in the inner workings of the language, it can be interesting to you.

### 12.1. Sentence Word Orders

In theory, there are six possible word orders for the transitive sentence. In practice, all of them are possible in Pandunia. They are made possible by the two verb endings, which decide the order of the other constituents (subject and object).

    1. With the verb ending in -a
        - object–subject–verb (OSV) : musike mi auda.
        - subject–verb–object (SVO) :        mi auda musike.
        - verb–object–subject (VOS) :           auda musike mi.
    2. With the verb ending in -u
        - subject-object-verb (SOV) : mi musike audu.
        - object-verb-subject (OVS) :    musike audu mi.
        - verb-subject-object (VSO) :           audu mi musike.

The constituent, which is further away from the verb, can be left out. So for example **musike mi auda** (OSV) can be truncated to **mi auda** (SV). Likewise **mi musike audu** (SOV) can be truncated to **musike audu** (OV).

The typical word orders in everyday Pandunia are SVO, SOV and OSV. The latter occurs frequently in dependant clauses, for example in **mi wida jen, jo tu suku.** (I saw the person _whom you like_.) The other word orders can be heard in poetry and in other forms of literary language.


### 12.2. Relations between the endings

A root is an idea that has many faces: a thing, a state, an action and a transition.

- E-word names a thing whose defining characteristic (in the given context) is the root.
- I-word describes another word by the root. The thing named by the other word is in the state of the root.
- A-word is an action that produces a thing that is characterized by the root. In other words, A-word produces the E-word.
- U-word is a transition that leads to the state of the root.

It makes always sense to apply the following formulas for a root that is an action.

1. Description: -i -e
    - **kitabi kitabe.** - Written writing.
    - **dansi danse.** - Danced dance.
    - **soni sone.** - Sleepy sleep.
    - **rangi range.** - Colored color.
2. Production: -a -e
    - **kitaba kitabe.** - To write a writing.
    - **dansa danse.** - To dance a dance.
    - **sona sone.** - To sleep a sleep.
    - **ranga range.** - To color a color.
3. Transition: -e -u
    - **kitabe kitabu.** - Writing gets written.
    - **danse dansu.** - Dance gets danced.
    - **sone sonu.** - Sleep gets slept.
    - **range rangu** - Color gets colored.

They are not very interesting things to be said, but they are true. Normally production and transition formulas are applied to other roots that belong to the same category as the original word. For example, we write different kinds of writings, including letters, books and novels, and we dance different kinds of dances, including tango, samba and polka.

The same formulas can be applied to roots that describe a state.

1. Description: -i -e
    - **nowi nowe.** - New news.
    - **longi longe** - Long length.
2. Production: -a -e
    - **nowa nowe.** - To renew the new.
    - **longa longe.** - To lengthen the length.
3. Transition: -e -u
    - **nowe nowu.** - The new get renewed.
    - **longe longu.** - The length gets lengthened.

Description formula still gives meaningful (though obvious) phrases. Production and transition formulas work better for gradual descriptions (like "length") than for binary descriptions (like "new"). When something is already new, it can't be made new. But when something is already long, it can be made even longer.



### 12.3. Hierarchy of Word Types

Spoken language is a flow of sounds which constitute words. Written language, in the case of Pandunia, is a flow of letters from left to right, which constitute words. So every expression is essentially a sequence of words. However all words are not equal. There is a hierarchy of words. The verb is the structural center of a sentence and other words are directly or indirectly connected to it.

Each sentence can be drawn as a tree diagram, where the central words are above and the dependant words are below. For example the sentence **mi wida tu** (I see you) can be pictured as a tree as follows.

    mi wida tu.

       wida
      ┌─┴─┐
     mi   tu

Adjectives and numerals point to their head word, the noun.

    mi wida sam jowan ren.

       wida
      ┌─┴──┐
     mi   ren
           |
         jowan
           |
          sam

The hierarchy of word types in Pandunia from the more to the less central is as follows.

1. Conjunctions: i, u, a
2. Connectors: da, du
3. Prepositions: na, ko, ze
4. Verbs
5. Nouns and pronouns
6. Tense, aspect and mood particles
7. Numerals
8. Adjectives

The following example shows how the scope affects the final position of words in the tree hierarchy. For example, although **i** is in general higher than **karena**, here its scope is only to connect **yusef** and **sara**. **karena** is at the top, because it connects the two sub-phrases.


    yusef i sara wol darsa pandunia karena ye si bon dunia bax.

                       karena
               ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              wol                   si
          ┌────┴──────┐           ┌──┴──┐
          i         darsa        ye    bax
      ┌───┴───┐    ┌──┴────┐            |
    yusef   sara       pandunia       dunia
                                        |
                                       bon
