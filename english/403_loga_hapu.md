## Sinitic words

Sinitic words are borrowed from East Asian languages, that include
different varieties of Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, etc.),
Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese
and sometimes also Malay, Filipino and Thai.
The common ancestor of Sinitic words in these languages is Middle Chinese,
which was spoken in ancient China.

Middle Chinese had three nasal finals, -n, -m and -ng,
and three stop finals, -p, -t and -k.
All of them are preserved by Cantonese, Vietnamese and Korean.
Mandarin has lost all final stops and it has merged -m to -n.
Japanese has kept only one final nasal
and a helping vowel is added after the final stops.

Middle Chinese was a tonal language
like the modern varieties of Chinese and Vietnamese.
The tone of a syllable is very important because it can differentiate one word from others.
For example, the syllable _ma_ means 'mother' in the first tone and 'horse' in the third tone in Mandarin.
Mandarin has four tones, which are numbered from 1 to 4.
The tone is often marked with a number after the syllable.
Pandunia is not a tonal language.
Therefore the Chinese tones are transformed into Pandunia in a changed form.

Every Sinitic word is borrowed to Pandunia in a form that is a compromise between the aforementioned languages.
The recipe for building a Sinitic word for Pandunia is the following:

1. Select the common initial consonant from Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean.
   Typically at least 2/3 of them agree.
   Japanese and Vietnamese have frequently changed it.
2. Select the medial vowel(s) from Mandarin, Cantonese and Japanese.
3. Select the final nasal or stop consonant from Cantonese, Japanese, Korean and/or Vietnamese.
   Typically at least 3/4 of them agree.
4. Transform the Mandarin tone into a final vowel.
    - Tone 1 → vowel **i**
    - Tone 2 → vowel **u**
    - Tone 3 → vowel **o**
    - Tone 4 → vowel **a**

Some examples of this word building process are shown in the table below.

| Mandarin | Cantonese | Japanese | Korean    | Vietnamese | Pandunia  |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 发 fa1  | 發 faat3 | 発 hatsu | 발 bal  | phát  | **fati**  |
| 罚 fa2  | 罰 fat6  | 罰 batsu | 벌 beol | phạt  | **fatu**  |
| 板 ban3 | 板 baan2 | 板 ban   | 판 pan  | bản   | **bano**  |
