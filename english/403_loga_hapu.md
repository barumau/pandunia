# Adapting international words to Pandunia

## Western words

Majority of international Western words are from Greek and Latin.
Pronunciation of several letters have changed since the Antiquity.
Pandunia uses modern pronunciation and phonemic spelling.
Therefore, for example the _soft c_ is witten with an **s**
and the _hard c_ is written with a **k**.

## Sinitic words

Sinitic words are borrowed from East Asian languages, that include
different varieties of Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese, Wu, etc.),
Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese
and sometimes also Malay, Filipino and Thai.
Standard Mandarin is the most widely spoken and the most learned language in this group of languages.

Every Sinitic word is borrowed to Pandunia in a form that is a compromise between the aforementioned languages.

#### Checked syllables

A "checked syllable" is a syllable type in Middle Chinese that had a specific tone and ended in one of the three stop consonants: -p, -t or -k.
The final stops have been preserved in Cantonese, Vietnamese, Japanese and Korean
but Mandarin has lost them.
Pandunia borrows Sinitic words with the final stops.

#### Tone transformation

Chinese is a tonal language.
Mandarin has four tones, which are numbered from 1 to 4.
The tone is marked with a number after the syllable.
Pandunia is not a tonal language.
Therefore the Chinese tones are transformed into Pandunia in a changed form.

The rules are applied only to syllables that end in
a nasal consonant (both in Mandarin and in Cantonese)
or a stop consonant (only in Cantonese).
The tone transformation rules are as follows:

1. Mandarin tone 1 > Add **i** after the final stop consonant
1. Mandarin tone 2 > Add **u** after the final nasal or stop consonant
1. Mandarin tone 3 > Add **o** after the final nasal or stop consonant
1. Mandarin tone 4 > Add **a** after the final nasal or stop consonant
