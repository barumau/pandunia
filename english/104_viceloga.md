# Pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

## Personal pronouns

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi**      | **mimen**    |
| I, me       | we           |
| **tu**      | **tumen**    |
| you         | you all      |
| **ya**      | **yamen**    |
| he or she   | they         |

All pronouns can be used for all genders.

The possessive pronouns consists of the personal pronoun and the possessive particle **di**.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi di**   | **mimen di** |
| my          | our          |
| **tu di**   | **tumen di** |
| your        | your         |
| **ya di**   | **yamen di** |
| his or her  | their        |


## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**se**
– self

Note! The same reflexive pronoun is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi vide se**
– I see myself.  
**ya vide se**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mimen vide se.**
– We see ourselves.

The word **semen** is used as the reciprocal pronoun.

**semen**
– each other, one another

**mi si tu vide semen.**
– Me and you see each other.  
**mimen vide semen.**
– We see each other.


## Demonstrative pronouns

The demonstrative pronouns are:

**ni**
– this  
**na**
– that  

The proximal demonstrative **ni** points to things that are near the speaker.
The distal demonstrative **na** points to things that are far from the speaker.

**ni si bon.**
– This is good.  
**na si dus.**
– That is bad.  
**mi vol ni buke, no na.**
– I want this book, not that.

The basic proximal and distal pronouns are used for introducing a new object.
The topical demonstrative **le**, on the other hand,
does not specify physical distance
but it is used when the speaker has already mentioned the object or person in question
and it is known by the audience or is topical within the discourse.

**ni si mau. ya vola yam na mushu.**
– This is a cat. It wants to eat that mouse.

**mi mala un mau si un vaf. le vaf si dai. ya yam pol yam.**
– I own a cat and a dog. The dog is big. It eats a lot of food.


### Abstract use

The demonstrative pronouns can be used also discourse internally.
Then they refer to abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects.
**le** refers to things previously spoken,
**ni** refers to things currently being spoken,
and **na** refers to things about to be spoken.

**ni jumle si korti.**
– This sentence is short.

In the above, **ni jumle** (_this sentence_) refers to the sentence being spoken.

**mi mana ni: mi ai tu.**
– I mean this: I love you. OR I mean that I love you.  
**mi ai tu. mi mana na.**
– I love you. That is what I mean.

In the above, the pronoun **ni** refers to the content of the next statement
and **na** refers to the content of the previous statement.


## Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ki**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ki xei?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ki jan?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ki zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  

The adverbial interrogative pronoun is **ko**
and it means the same as English _how_.

Also adjectives are questioned with **ko**.

**ko novi?**
– How new?  
**ko kosti?**
– How costy?  
**ko poli?**
– How many?  
**ko dai?**
– How big?  
**ko lili?**
– How small?

**tu tena ko dai mau?**
– How big cat do you have?
