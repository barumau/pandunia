# Pronouns

Pronouns can substitute nouns and noun phrases.

## Personal pronouns

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi**      | **mimen**    |
| I, me       | we           |
| **tu**      | **tumen**    |
| you         | you all      |
| **ya**      | **yamen**    |
| he or she   | they         |

All pronouns can be used for all genders.

The possessive pronouns consists of the personal pronoun and the possessive particle **su**.

| Singular    | Plural       |
|:------------|:-------------|
| **mi su**   | **mimen su** |
| my          | our          |
| **tu su**   | **tumen su** |
| your        | your         |
| **ya su**   | **yamen su** |
| his or her  | their        |


## Reflexive pronoun

The reflexive pronoun is used when the object of a sentence is the same as the subject.

**se**
– self

Note! The same reflexive pronoun is used for all persons,
so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, _ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi vide se**
– I see myself.  
**ya vide se**
– She sees herself. / He sees himself. / It sees itself.  
**mimen vide se.**
– We see ourselves.

The expression **se kon** is used as the reciprocal pronoun.

**se kon**
– each other, one another

**mi si tu vide se kon.**
– Me and you see each other.  
**mimen vide se kon.**
– We see each other.


## Demonstrative pronouns

Demonstrative pronouns are used with nouns to make them more specific.
The demonstrative pronouns in Pandunia are:

**ni**
– this (near the speaker)  
**go**
– that (far from speaker)  
**la**
– the (known by both the speaker and the listener)

In Pandunia, **ni**, **go** and **la** work only as modifiers
and they always require a noun after them.
To use them like pronouns, a generic noun like
**she**
('thing') needs to be added after these words.

The proximal demonstrative
**ni**
points to things that are near the speaker.
The distal demonstrative
**go**
points to things that are far from the speaker.

**ni she si bon.**
– This (thing) is good.  
**go she si dus.**
– That (thing) is bad.  
**mi vol ni buke, no go.**
– I want this book, not that.

The basic proximal and distal pronouns are used for introducing a new object.
The topical demonstrative **a**, on the other hand,
does not specify physical distance
but it is used when the speaker has already mentioned the object or person in question
and it is known by the audience or is topical within the discourse.

**ni she si mau. ya vol yam go mushu.**
– This is a cat. It wants to eat that mouse.

**mi ten un mau e un vaf. la vaf si dai. ya yam poli yam.**
– I have a cat and a dog. The dog is big. It eats a lot of food.


### Abstract use

The demonstrative pronouns can be used also discourse internally.
Then they refer to abstract entities of discourse, not concrete objects.
**la** refers to things previously spoken,
**ni** refers to things currently being spoken,
and **go** refers to things about to be spoken.

**ni jumle si korte.**
– This sentence is short.

In the above, **ni jumle** (_this sentence_) refers to the sentence being spoken.

**mi mana go: mi ama tu.**
– I mean this: I love you. OR I mean that I love you.  
**mi ama tu. mi mana ni.**
– I love you. That is what I mean.

In the above, the pronoun **ni** refers to the content of the next statement
and **a** refers to the content of the previous statement.


## Interrogative pronouns

**ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun.
It does the job of English words _who_ and _what_.

**ke?**
– Who or what?  

The adjectival interrogative pronoun is **ke**
and it means the same as English _which_.

**ke she?**
– What? (Which thing?)  
**ke jan?**
– Who? (Which person?)  
**ke zaman?**
– When? (What time?)  

Also adjectives are questioned with **ke**.

**ke nove?**
– How new?  
**ke koste?**
– How costy?  
**ke poli?**
– How many?  
**ke dai?**
– How big?  
**ke lili?**
– How small?

**tu tena ke dai di mau?**
– How big cat do you have?
