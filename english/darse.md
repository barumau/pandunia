<big>👩🏻</big>
**halo!**
= Hello!  
<big>🧑🏾</big>
**salam!**
= Hello!  
<big>👩🏻</big>
**tu e ke?**
= Who are you?  
<big>🧑🏾</big>
**mi e Yusef. tu e ke?**
= I am Yusef. Who are you?  
<big>👩🏻</big>
**mi e Sara. ya e ke?**
= I am Sara. Who is that?  
<big>🧑🏾</big>
**ya e mi di doste.**

<big>👩🏻</big>
**ya di nam e ke?**

<big>🧑🏾</big>
**ya di nam e Maria.**
= Her name is Maria.

### Grammar

Pandunia's sentences normally follow the topic-comment structure. 
The topic indicates who or what is being talked about. The comment
tells something about the topic. For instance in **ya e mi di doste**
the topic is the pronoun **ya** (he, she, it), which is followed by
the comment **e mi di doste** (is my friend).

In Pandunia, the word **e** functions like _to be_ in English.
The same word is used for all persons. And to say the opposite, 
simply replace it with **no** (which is the word for _no_).

**ya e Sara.**
= She is Sarah.  
**ya no e Sara.**
= She is not Sarah.

**mau e zou.**
= The cat is an animal.  
**dom no e zou.**
= The house is not an animal.  

In the same way you can describe yourself by saying
**mi e**
and a word that describes you.

**mi e bon.**
= I'm good.  
**mi e man.**
= I'm a man.  
**mi e fem.**
= I'm a woman.

## Saying hello

**salam**
= Hello!

This is how people often greet each other in Pandunia.
They say **salam**.
It is used for saying both hello and goodbye.

**salam**
= Bye!

The word
**salam**
means "greeting".
It is originally a Middle Eastern word for wishing well-being, health and safety.
It appears as "shlaam" in Aramaic, the language that Jesus of Nazareth spoke,
in Hebrew it is "shalom",
and in Arabic it is "salaam".
Today it is a common greeting in hundreds of languages in Africa, Asia and Europe.
Pandunia is a constructed world language
that borrows international words from all parts of the world.

The verb form of **salam** is **salam**, which means "to greet".

**mi salam tu.**
= I greet you.  
**tu salam mi.**
= You greet me.

These are active sentences. In active sentences the subject does the
action to the object. In **mi salam tu** the first word, **mi**, is
the subject, **salam** is the verb (action word), and **tu** is the
object. The order of subject, verb and object is the normal word order
in Pandunia.

> Word order in active sentence: Subject + Verb + Object

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, and
**ya** = he, she, it. Note that the pronouns stayed the same in the
previous example sentences. Words never change in Pandunia. They
always stay the same regardless of their position in sentence.

In Pandunia sentences can be made shorter by leaving out pronouns
that are obvious in the present situation.

**mi salam tu!**
= I greet you.  
**salam tu!**
= Greetings to you! (It is obvious that the speaker is the one who greets.)  
**salam!**
= Greeting! (It is obvious that the listeners are greeted.)  
**salam!**
= Hello!

Another Pandunia word for greeting is **halo**. It is also a very
international greeting. You can choose freely, which word to use when
you greet people.

**halo!**
= Hello!

You may use both **salam** and **halo**
to address people by name, kinship term or profession.

**halo, toni!**
= Hello, Tony!  
**salam, mama!**
= Hello, mother!  
**halo, papa!**
= Hello, father!  
**salam, shefe!**
= Hello, chief!

## Making requests

### Dialog

<big>🧒</big>
**halo!**
= Hello!  
<big>🧓</big>
**halo! ching side.**
= Hello! Please sit!  
<big>🧒</big>
**danke.**
= Thank you.  
<big>🧓</big>
**ching yam kafe o chai.**
= Please have some coffee or tea.  
<big>🧒</big>
**mi vol chai. danke.**
= I will have some tea, thank you.  
...  
<big>🧓</big>
**ching salam tu di mama!**
= Please tell greetings to your mother.  
<big>🧒</big>
**mi salam ya. salam reste!**
= I will. Bye!  
<big>🧓</big>
**salam gou!**
= Bye!


### Grammar

Pandunia's personal pronouns are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, and
**ya** = he, she, it. Pandunia is a gender-neutral language. It
doesn't distinguish between sexes in the third person pronoun or any
of the pronouns. All the personal pronouns are present in the
following example sentence.

**mi ching tu salam ya.**
= I ask you to say hello to him/her.

This sentence has a _pivot structure_. The first verb, **ching** = to
request, addresses **tu** as its object. At the same time **tu**
serves also as the subject of the second verb, **salam** = to greet,
whose object is **ya**. So **tu** has a double role: (1) object of
the first verb and (2) subject of the second verb. Hence, it is the
_pivot_ or hinge between the two verbs.

> Pivot Stucture: Subject + Verb¹ + Object/Subject + Verb² + Object

The pivot structure is a common structure in Pandunia.

Remember that it is allowed to leave out pronouns that are known in
the context. In other words the speaker can safely assume that the
listeners know who he or she is talking about. So it is unnecessary
to keep on repeating them. In this manner phrases can be made shorter.

**mi ching tu salam ya.**
= I ask you to say hello to him/her.  
**ching salam ya.**
= Please say hello to him/her.

See how the translation of **ching** changed between the two sentences?
The meaning of the word, the concept, did not change, but its use did.
English reflects this change by using different words, to ask and please.
Pandunia can cope with changes like this without resorting to different
words. It is a principle in Pandunia that there is always exactly one
word for one concept. Different words are not created just because the
grammatical role of a concept changes.

The phrase **ching salam ya** has a useful pattern that can be used
for making polite requests.

**ching side.**
= Please be seated.  
**ching dona kafe.**
= Please give me some coffee.  
**ching dona chai.**
= Please give me some tea.  
**ching yam chai.**
= Please have some tea.  
**ching safa kamar.**
= Please clean the room.

Commands are introduced with **amira** = to command. They employ the
same pivot structure as requests with **ching**.

**amira dona chai.**
= Give (me) some tea!  
**amira safa kamar.**
= Clean the room!

In practice, direct commands can be also made with just one verb and
a commanding voice.

**safa ya!**
= Clean it!

## Yes or no questions

### Dialog

**salam! sual tu yam kafe o chai?**
= Hello! Would you like to have coffee or tea?  
<big>🧔</big>
**chai.**
= Tea.  
<big>👩‍🍳</big>

**maf! sual ya yam chai?**

### Asking questions

Questions that can be answered by saying _yes_ or _no_ have the same
pivot structure as requests with **ching**, which you learned in the
previous lesson. Question sentences are introduced with **sual** = to ask.

**mi sual tu yam chai.**
= I ask (do) you drink tea.  
**sual tu yam chai?**
= Do you drink tea?  
**sual yam chai?**
= Drink tea?

Requests usually concern the one or the ones spoken to, but questions
are often about other people. Therefore the second pronoun is usually
needed. It can be left out only when it is clear who is the topic of
discussion.

**sual ya yam chai?**
= Does he or she drink tea?  
**sual tu yam supe?**
= Do you eat soup?  
**sual mimen yam sui?**
= Do we drink water?

Of course common and proper nouns can also be used.

**sual shefe yam kafe?**
= Does the chief drink coffee?  
**sual papa safa kamar?**
= Does the father clean the room?  
**sual niki basha pandunia?**
= Does Nicky speak Pandunia?


### Giving answers

Yes/no questions can be answered with **ye** = yes, and **no** = no.

– **sual tu yam supe?**
= Do you eat soup?  
– **ye.**
= Yes.  
– **sual ya yam supe?**
= Does she eat soup?  
– **no.**
= No.

Also more complete answers can be given.

– **sual tu yam kafe?**
= Do you drink coffee?  
– **ye. mi yam kafe.**
= Yes, I drink coffee.  
– **sual ya yam kafe?**
= Does he drink coffee?  
– **no. ya no yam kafe.**
= No, he doesn't drink coffee.

It is also possible to answer yes by repeating the main verb of the question.

– **sual tu yam sui?**
= Do you drink water?  
– **yam.**
= (Yes, I) drink.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saying no

In the previous lesson you learned to answer **ye** and **no** to questions.
The word **no** is used for denying something.
Adding **no** in front of the verb turns an affirmative sentence to negative.

**mi salam tu.**
= I greet you.  
**mi no salam tu.**
= I do not greet you.

Conceptually negation means the absence or non-existence of the
negated word. In the phrase **mi no salam tu** the negative word
**no** denies the existence of greeting.

In Pandunia the negative word affects the word that follows it.
Different scopes of negation may result depending on the location
of the negative word.

**mi ching tu safa kamar.**
= I ask you to clean the room.  
**mi no ching tu safa kamar.**
= I do NOT ask you to clean the room.  
**mi ching tu no safa kamar.**
= I ask you NOT to clean the room.

The negated word can be of any type: verb, pronoun, noun, adjective
and even numeral.

**ya no tena mau.**
= She doesn't have a cat.  
**ya tena no mau, a vaf.**
= She has no cats but dogs.  
**no ya, a mi tena mau.**
= Not she but I have cats.  
**mi tena no un, a du mau.**
= I have not one but two cats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## More Questions

To ask questions beginning with _what_, _which_, _how_, _who_ and
_when_, the interrogative pronoun **ki** is normally used. The
question can be made more specific by adding words for person, time,
manner or thing if needed.

**ya e ke?**
= What is that? / Who is (s)he?  
**ki jen lai?**
= Who is coming? (**jen** = person)  
**ki zaman tu yam?**
= When do you eat? (**zaman** = time)  
**ki yang dance?**
= How to dance? (**yang** = manner, style)

In Pandunia, questions beginning with _why_ are asked using
**ke saba**.

**ke saba tu suka mau?**
= Why do you like cats?

Questions asking about the cause or reason of something, are answered
by adding **sabu** before the cause or reason. **sabu** is actually a
passive verb meaning _to be caused by_.

**ke saba tu suka mau?**
= Why do you like cats?  
**sabu yamen kavai.**
= Because they are cute.

Of course **sabu** can also be used to express the cause or reason for
something, even when not answering to a question.

**mi suka mau sabu yamen kavai**
= I like cats because they are cute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Past, present and future

### Expressing time

There are no verb conjugations in Pandunia. All verbs have only one
form for all times. In a way they are similar to some English verbs,
such as "to hit", which is the same in all tenses.

**mi darba ya.**
= I hit it.

In Pandunia all verbs are like that! For example, **mi yam pang**
can mean both "I eat bread" and "I ate bread", but usually only one
or the other meaning makes sense in the context of the discussion.
For example when people talk about that morning's breakfast, the
sentence tells about the past time.

**mi yam pang a suba yam.**
= I ate bread for morning meal.

There are also specific time words.

**gang**
= just, recently  
**zai**
= currently, at the moment  
**sun**
= soon  
**vil**
= later, in the future

They can be used for modifying nouns.

**Sara e mi di pas shefe.**
= Sarah is my former boss.  
**Yusef e mi di zai shefe.**
= Yusef is my current boss.  
**Maria e mi di vil shefe.**
= Maria is my future boss.

The same words are used when you talk about actions and events in time.
Simply put the word before the verb.

**mi pas darba ya.**
= I hit it (in the past).  
**mi zai darba ya.**
= I am hitting it (currently).  
**mi vil darba ya.**
= I will hit it (in the future).

It's also possible to use preposition phrases of time.

**mi darba ya a pas.**
= I hit it in the past.  
**mi darba ya a zai.**
= I hit it at present.  
**mi darba ya a vil.**
= I hit it in the future.


It is not necessary to repeat the time expressions all the time.
It would be awkward.
It is enough to set the stage once in the beginning with a time expression.
Another time word will not be needed until the tense changes
or until it becomes useful to stress that you are still talking in the same tense.

**mi pas tena un mau.**
= I had a cat in the past.  
**ya e bon mau.**
= It was a good cat.  
**mi tena un vaf a zai.**
= I have a dog now.

Any expression of time is good for expressing the tense. When one
time expression is present, other markers are not needed.

**mi jen a nen 2003.**
= I was born in 2003.  
**ya safi le kamar a pos den.**
= He will clean the room tomorrow.
