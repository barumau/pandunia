# Word classes in Pandunia

## Content words and structure words

A word class is a group of words that have similar forms and similar use in sentences.
In Pandunia, word classes belong to two superclasses: **content words** and **structure words**.
Content words are the words for things in the world outside the language,
for example *house, person, love, beauty* and *now*.
Structure words operate always inside the structure of the language,
and they have little meaning or only a transient meaning in the world outside the language.
The job of structure words is to connect content words into meaningful phrases.

Content words convey most of information and meaning.
You can't say anything meaningful without them,
but they don't make any sense without structure words,
which are the necessary words for grammar.
You need structure words to put content words together into more or less complex sentences.
Content words are like bricks of information and structure words are like the mortar that holds them together.

In Pandunia, it is easy to identify structure words because they always consist of only one syllable.
Content words, on the other hand, are typically longer.
Structure words are best explained in the grammar,
whereas the meaning of content words can be explained briefly with a dictionary.

## Word classes

Structure words can be categorized into word classes as follows:

1. Pronouns : words that point to people and things.
2. Prepositions : words that relate things and actions to circumstances
3. Conjunctions : words that join phrases together

Content words can be classified into the following word classes:

1. Nouns : words for things, ideas, places and people.
   Nouns answer to the question *what*.
2. Adjectives : words for qualities of nouns, such as good, bad, and big.
   Adjectives answer to the question *what kind*.
3. Adverbs : words that describe degrees of qualities, such as less, more and very.
   Adverbs answer to the questions *how*, *where* and *when*.
4. Numerals : words for numbers and amounts.
   Adjectives answer to the questions *how many* and *how much*.
5. Verbs : words for actions and occurences, such as to eat and to look.
   Verbs answer to the question *what happened*.


## Word class roles in Mini Pandunia

In Mini Pandunia, the class of a content word is seldom permanent.
Words take different roles depending on their position in sentences.
For example, the word
**amə**
'love' can function as a verb, noun or adjective as demonstrated below.

**me _amə_ te.**
– I _love_ you. (verb)  
**te emosə me da _amə_.**
– You feel my _love_. (noun)  
**me kitabə un _amə_ misajə.**
– I write a _love_ letter. (adjective)


## Word class markers in Midi Pandunia

Midi Pandunia uses vowel endings for quick word derivation.
In this system the final vowel of a word indicates its word class.
So the stem of the word indicates a general idea
and the vowel endings indicate different sides of that idea.

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of word from another.
One ending is simply changed to another ending.
All endings can be used on all word stems in the same way.

- The ending **-e** converts the idea to a thing and the word to a noun.
  For example, **nile** means 'blue color, blueness'.
- The ending **-i** converts the idea to a description and the word to an adjective.
  The resulting adjective describes another idea with the modifying idea.
  For example, **nili dome** means 'blue house'.
- The ending **-a** converts the idea to an action and the word to a verb.
  The resulting verb is about using the idea to an object.
  For example, **nila dome** means 'to make the house blue'.
- The ending **-u** creates an action just like **-a**.
  The only difference is that the word order is the opposite.
  For example, **dome nilu** means 'the house becomes blue'.

The same word class markers are used also in Maxi Pandunia
but they can be followed by other inflectional suffixes in the same word.
For example, the Maxi Pandunia word **domem** consists of the stem and two suffixes: *dom-e-m*.
The same thing is said with two words in Midi Pandunia and the word class markers are clearly visible: **mi dome** 'my house'.
