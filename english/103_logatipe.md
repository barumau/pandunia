# Word classes in Pandunia

## Content words and structure words

A word class is a group of words that have similar forms and similar use in sentences.
In Pandunia, word classes belong to two superclasses: **content words** and **structure words**.
Content words are the words for things in the world outside the language,
for example *house, person, love, beauty* and *now*.
Structure words operate always inside the structure of the language,
and they have little meaning or only a transient meaning in the world outside the language.
The job of structure words is to connect content words into meaningful phrases.

Content words convey most of information and meaning.
You can't say anything meaningful without them,
but they don't make any sense without structure words,
which are the necessary words for grammar.
You need structure words to put content words together into more or less complex sentences.
Content words are like bricks of information and structure words are like the mortar that holds them together.

In Pandunia, it is easy to identify structure words because they always consist of only one syllable.
Content words, on the other hand, are typically longer.
Structure words are best explained in the grammar,
whereas the meaning of content words can be explained briefly with a dictionary.

## Word classes

Structure words can be categorized into word classes as follows:

1. Pronouns : words that point to people and things.
2. Prepositions : words that relate things and actions into circumstances
3. Conjunctions : words that join phrases together

Content words can be classified into the following word classes:

1. Nouns : words for things, ideas, places and people.
   Nouns answer to the question *what*.
2. Adjectives : words for qualities of nouns, such as good, bad, and big.
   Adjectives answer to the question *what kind*.
3. Adverbs : words that describe degrees of qualities, such as less, more and very.
   Adverbs answer to the questions *how*, *where* and *when*.
4. Numerals : words for numbers and amounts.
   Adjectives answer to the questions *how many* and *how much*.
5. Verbs : words for actions and occurences, such as to eat and to look.
   Verbs answer to the question *what happened*.

## Word class markers in Midi Pandunia

The designated vowel endings enable easy derivation of one type of word from another.
An ending is simply changed to another ending.
All endings can be used on all roots in the same way.

- The ending **-e** converts the idea into a thing.
  For example, **nile** means 'blue color, blueness'.
- The ending **-i** converts the idea into a description.
  The resulting adjective describes another idea with the modifying idea.
  For example, **nili dome** means 'blue house'.
- The ending **-a** converts the idea into an action.
  The resulting verb is about using the idea to an object.
  For example, **nila dome** means 'to make the house blue'.
- The ending **-u** creates an action just like **-a**.
  The only difference is that the word order is the opposite.
  For example, **dome nilu** means 'the house becomes blue'.
