# Pandunia - a global contact language
 
 
 
## Introduction

This article describes why and how Pandunia was created to be an equally global auxiliary language.

## The big picture

Many people are used to seeing this kind of world map. It is the famous _Mercator projection_ map. Unfortunately it distorts the land area terribly.

![](http://www.lovelljohns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mercator.jpg "Mercator projection")

Why is that? The world is a 3-dimensional globe and drawing it into a flat, 2-dimensional map is not easy. Equal-area projections, such as _Peter's projection_ below, show land areas correctly. Compare the sizes of Greenland and Africa in these two maps. In the Mercator projection Greenland appears bigger, but the Peters projection shows correctly that in reality Africa is 14 times bigger than Greenland.

That is the natural world. We live also in a human world, which is divided by borders between nations. In a normal map of world countries, sizes of the countries are defined by their geographic area.

However the map projection below is based on the population of countries, not their geographic area.

In our opinion the world language should represent the human world. Every part of the world, every culture, should be treated fairly and democratically. The grammar should be easy for all. Areal language characteristics such as [Standard Average European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Average_European) are not suitable guidelines for the world language. Rather the grammar should be built from things that are universally known and/or universally considered easy.


## Languages of the world and world languages

The 15 most widely spoken languages in the world are listed in the table below. The table is ordered by the number of native speakers. The numbers are educated estimates based on data in Ethnologue and in Wikipedia.

| Ranking | Language         | Native speakers | Non-native speakers |
|:-------:|:-----------------|----------------:|--------------------:|
|  1      | Mandarin Chinese |     899 million |  178 million        |
|  2      | English          |     500 million |  510 million        |
|  3      | Spanish          |     500 million |   70 million        |
|  4      | Hindi-Urdu       |     438 million |  214 million        |
|  5      | Arabic           |     290 million |  132 million        |
|  6      | Portuguese       |     230 million |   32 million        |
|  7      | Bengali          |     226 million |   19 million        |
|  8      | Russian          |     160 million |  115 million        |
|  9      | Punjabi          |     146 million |    1 million        |
| 10      | Japanese         |     130 million |    1 million        |
| 11      | German           |      95 million |   15 million        |
| 12      | Hausa            |      85 million |   65 million        |
| 13      | French           |      80 million |  192 million        |
| 14      | Telugu           |      80 million |   12 million        |
| 15      | Malay-Indonesian |      77 million |  204 million        |

The numbers make it clear that Mandarin Chinese is by far the largest language in the world counted by native speakers, while English is the language with the greatest number of second language speakers. Both of their number of speakers reaches one billion. However they are followed by languages, whose speakers are also counted in hundreds of millions.

It is estimated that over 6000 different languages are spoken in the world.

However, native and non-native speakers of the 5 most widely spoken languages together add up to more than half of the total population of the world. Also these five languages represent different language typologies well and they also represent the five main divisions of international vocabularies.

### World word heritage

English and Spanish carry the heritage of Latin and Greek, which have greatly influenced all languages of Europe, America and beyond, including French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Polish and Russian.

Mandarin Chinese carries the Sinitic heritage of Old Chinese, which has greatly influenced all other East Asian languages, including Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and other varieties of Chinese.

Hindi-Urdu carries the heritage of Sanskrit, which has influenced also all other languages of South and South-East Asia, including Bengali, Punjabi, Telugu, Tamil, Burmese, Khmer, Thai, Malay and Indonesian.

Arabic and Hindi-Urdu (Urdu more than Hindi) carry the Perso-Arabic heritage, which has greatly influenced languages in Central, South-West, South and South-East Asia and North, West and East Africa, including Turkish, Persian, Bengali, Punjabi, Telugu, Indonesian, Hausa, Wolof, Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Swahili.



## Relatively simple structure

Languages can be categorized by two parameters:

- Is a single word made of few or many parts?
- Are those parts easy to separate or fused together?

The widely spoken languages can be divided into four types according to these parameters.

1. Analytic languages – Words are made of few, distinct parts.
    - Mandarin Chinese
2. Analytic fusional languages – Words are made of few, fused parts.
    - English
3. Agglutinative languages – Words are made of many, distinct parts.
    - Japanese, Malay-Indonesian, Telugu
4. Synthetic fusional languages – Words are made of many, fused parts.
    - Spanish, Portuguese, French
    - German, Russian
    - Hindi-Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi
    - Arabic, Hausa

Usually languages are a mixture of different types. For example, in English the plural can be formed in several different ways. _Many a cat_ is an analytic phrase that consists of three separate words. _Cats_ is an agglutinative word that consists of two distincts parts (_cat_ and _-s_). _Leaves_ is a fused word that consists of two parts (_leaf_ and _-s_).

Pandunia belongs to the first type. It is an analytic language. Its words consist of few parts and they are clearly separable. This is a good thing because it makes the language easy to learn and use in comparison to languages where words in average are long and consist of many parts.


### Parts of word

The word is made of a root and optional affixes, which are attached to the root. Prefixing languages put affixes before the root and suffixing languages put affixes after the root. Some languages put affixes on both sides or even inside the root. Usually languages use several different ways. For example English uses both prefixes (ex. un-kind) and suffixes (kind-ly)

Suffixing languages are the most common type. Indo-European languages, Telugu, Chinese and Japanese are mainly suffixing.

Arabic, Hausa


Chinese has no inflection. Words are only combined to larger words. Some words have a special meaning when they appear as a part of a larger word. (These are called [bound morphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_and_unbound_morphemes)).

English, Spanish and Hindustani use mainly _root and affix system_. The meaning is changed by adding dependent parts before and after the root. For example "booklets" consists of root _book_ and affixes _-let_ (which adds meaning of smallness) and _-s_ (which adds plural meaning). Most affixes can't appear alone, but they need a root.

Arabic uses [root and pattern system](https://www.britannica.com/topic/root-and-pattern-system). The root consists of (usually three) consonants and the root is inflected by inserting a pattern of vowels between them. Arabic also has affixes for creating additional words from root and pattern.

Pandunia uses _root and affix system_. The principles of this system are known to most people. New words can be created easily.


### Parts of speech

There is no systematic marking for parts of speech in any of the control languages.


supra = surpass, go over


### Word orders

Different word orders are used in the languages of the world. Some of the most important areas of word order are:

- Sentence structure. Order of subject (S), verb (V) and object (O) in a transitive clause. The most common sentence structures are subject-verb-object (SVO) and object-verb-subject (SOV).
- Order of numeral and noun. Cardinal numeral can either precede (NumN) or follow (NNum) the noun.
- Order of adjective and noun. There are two possible orders
    1. Adjective precedes the noun (AdjN)
    2. Adjective follows the noun (NAdj)
- Order of adposition and noun.
    1. Prepositions precede the noun.
    2. Postpositions follow the noun.
- Order of relative clause and noun. The relative clause can either precede (RelN) or follow (NRel) the noun.

The table below shows what are the typical, unmarked word orders in several important world languages.

| Language   | Sentence | Numeral | Adjective | Relative | Adposition |
|------------|:--------:|:-------:|:---------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| English    | SVO      | NumN    | AdjN      | NRel     | pre        |
| Chinese    | SVO      | NumN    | AdjN      | RelN     | post       |
| Spanish    | SVO      | NumN    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |
| Hindi-Urdu | SOV      | NumN    | AdjN      | RelN     | post       |
| Arabic     | VSO      | both    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |
| Russian    | SVO      | NumN    | AdjN      | NRel     | pre        |
| French     | SVO      | NumN    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |
| Indonesian | SVO      | NumN    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |
| Japanese   | SOV      | NumN    | AdjN      | RelN     | post       |
| Swahili    | SVO      | NNum    | NAdj      | NRel     | pre        |

Also other word orders can be possible. For example in English, which normally uses the SVO order in declarative sentences, the object can be fronted in interrogative and relative clauses, like in "What did you say?"

We can see from the previous table that languages do not agree about word orders. There are three main types of languages:

1. Languages where the main word comes first have typically SVO, NNum, NAdj, NRel and prepositions.
2. Languages where the main word comes last have typically SOV, NumN, AdjN, RelN and postpositions.
3. Languages with mixed or free word order.

The third type is the most attractive for the world auxiliary language, which has to welcome people with many different speaking habits. It doesn't make the language only versatile but also more interesting!

Pandunia allows different word orders. This is achieved mainly by the verb endings -a and -u, which signal reverse word orders. In Pandunia verbs can function also as adpositions (so called _coverbs_).

**mi ama tu.** (SVO)  
**mi tu amu.** (SOV)  
I love you.

**mi salta supra meza gawi.** (I jump, surpass the table high.)  
**mi salta gawi meza supru.** (I jump, the high table is-surpassed.)  
I jump over the high table.


### Syllable patterns

Often it is said that Spanish has simple syllable patterns. However there are also more complex ones, like these: us|ted, vo|sot|ros, cris|tal, abs|trac|to, pers|pec|ti|va, trans|for|mar.

Pandunia allows the syllable patterns that are shown in the table below.
V = vowel  
C = consonant  
L = liquid consonant (l, r or y)  
N = nasal  

| Pattern | Examples           |
|---------|--------------------|
| V       | i, u, a, ata       |
| CV      | de, ma, pa, batata |
| CVV     | dia, hua           |
| VC      | el, as             |
| CVC     | man, raq, kup, ted |
| CLVC    | grup, klas, nyam   |
| CVNC    | dant               |
| CLVNC   | kramp              |

Simple patterns are more frequent than complex patterns.
 
## Phonotactics
 
Allowed final consonants
 
| Language   | Nasals | Resonants | Voiceless stops | Voiced stops | Fricatives | Clusters |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Mandarin   | n ng   | r         | -               | -            | -          | none     |
| English    | m n ng | r l       | p t k ch        | b d g j      | s z sh zh  | complex  |
| Spanish    | n      | r l       | -               | d            | s          | none     |
| Hindustani | m n ~  | r l       | p t k c         | b d g j      | s sh       | simple   |
| Arabic     | m n    | r l       | p t k           | b d g        | s z sh     | none     |
| Russian    | m n ñ  | r l       | p t k ch        | -            | s sh x     | complex  |

## Morphology
 
Many languages treat proper nouns in a special way. Names don't have to conform to the morphology of the language.
 
We must assume that the interlanguage has to deal with names in all shapes and sizes, such as Tim, Mei, Maria, Muhamad, Idris and Yuri. Some of them might not conform to the morphology of the interlanguage. For example in Esperanto all nouns end in -o. So what to do with all possible proper nouns? Should names be adapted for the language, or should the language be adapted to accept different kinds of names?
 
It is reasonable to let proper nouns be as they were. Pandunia accepts all names without any changes. (However in practice it is wise to convert them to the Pandunia alphabet.) So there is a large group of nouns that do not conform to any morphological constraints.
 
This situation is a problem in Esperanto, where all nouns should end in -o. So should all names, such as Tim, Joanne, Lee and Maria, be "localized" to Esperanto?

## Loan words
 
### Western words
 
Typically Western words have this structure: prefix + root + suffixes. Usually the root ends in a consonant.

For example in Spanish, the root cort- (short) can be combined with affixes to produce different kinds of words.

- Adjectives: corto (masc.), corta (fem.)
- Noun: cortedad
- Verb: acortar

Also English uses comparable affixes.

- Adjectives: short, shorter, shortest
- Nouns: shortness, shorty
- Verb: shorten

Pandunia borrows the roots of Western words. The goal is to select a form that sounds familiar to speakers of as many languages as possible.

| Pandunia root | English    | Portuguese | Spanish    | French     | German     | Russian    |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **kort**      | short      | curto      | corto      | court      | kurz       | korotkiy   |
| **now**       | new        | novo       | nuevo      | nouveau    | neu        | novıy      |
| **marc**      | march      | marcha     | marcha     | marche     | Marsch     | marš       |
| **post**      | post (mail)| (postal)   | posta      | poste      | Post       | počta      |

The suffixes of Pandunia are applied on the roots. Here are some resulting Pandunia words: korti (short), korte (shorty), korta (shorten), nowi (new), nowe (news), nowa (renovate).

### Indian words

### Sinitic words

Sinitic words are words from Middle Chinese that are used today in languages of East Asia, including Chinese languages, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Sinitic words are single-syllable words or compounds of syllabic elements.

Middle Chinese had lexical tone. Today Chinese languages and Vietnamese have tones but they are not the same as in Middle Chinese. Japanese and Korean are not tonal languages so they have ignored the tones. Also Pandunia ignores the tones. (To ignore the tones is about the same as to ignore the stress accent or pitch accent of other source languages.)

Middle Chinese had unreleased stop consonants, which are usually written -p, -t and -k. Cantonese, Vietnamese and Korean keep them mostly as they were. Mandarin has deleted them. Japanese has added a vowel to ease pronunciation. Pandunia keeps the final stops and adds a normal PoS suffix.
 
| 字 | Pandunia root | Cantonese  | Mandarin   | Japanese   | Korean     | Vietnamese |
|----|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 水 | **suy**       | sui        | shuǐ       | sui        | su         | thuỷ       |
| 中 | **jung**      | zung       | zhōng      | chū        | jung       | trung      |
| 心 | **xim**       | sam        | xīn        | shin       | sim        | tâm        |
| 門 | **mun**       | mun        | mén        | mon        | mun        | (môn)      |
| 問 | **wen**       | man        | wèn        | mon        | mun        | vấn        |
| 讀 | **dug**       | duk        | dú         | doku       | dog        | đọc        |
| 出 | **cud**       | cœt        | chū        | shutsu     | chul       | xuất       |
| 索 | **sog**       | sok        | suǒ        | saku       | sæg        |            |
| 惡 | **ag**        | ok         | è          | aku        | ag         | ác         |

Applying the suffixes of Pandunia to Sinitic roots may seem unusual at first, but it is nothing new – Sinitic words are already inflected in Korean!

### Perso-Arabic words
 
 
 
### African words
 
Words in Bantu languages normally have this structure: prefix + root + affixes. Normally the root ends in a consonant. Only the root is borrowed to Pandunia.

## A pidgin language

Pandunia is so simple because it is modeled after pidgins. A pidgin is a simplified version of a language that develops when people need to communicate but they do not speak a common language. So they create a new common language on the spot. They pick up words from the dominant language and use them in a new way to communicate with each other. The only goal is to communicate, so pidgins typically leave behind unnecessary grammatical features from the source language, including inflection, gender marking, number marking, verb conjugation, definite and indefinite articles and so on.

All pidgins resemble each other in their simplicity. That's why it can be said that they have a universal minimal grammar. That kind of grammar is ideal for the world language – the world pidgin!

## The best-known alphabet

English is written in the Roman alphabet, which is also used by many languages on every continent of the world. Standard Chinese is written in Chinese characters, which form a system so complex that school children learn the Roman alphabet first. This system of romanization is known as Pīnyīn. Therefore it is logical that Pandunia be also written in the Roman alphabet.

### Only five vowels

Both English and Chinese have rich vowel inventories. English has 14-20 vowels, depending on the dialect, and Standard Chinese has 9 vowels (and many more vowel qualities). These are comparatively high numbers considering that globally the average vowel inventory size is only 5-6 vowels.

Pandunia has only 5 pure vowels: a, e, i, o, u. In this respect, it is close to languages such as Spanish, Swahili, Japanese and Indonesian, which have simple vowel inventories.

### Common consonants

Pandunia's consonant inventory is smaller than that of English and Mandarin. Majority of the consonant letters are pronounced in the same way in all three languages. The table below shows how consonant sounds are mapped from Pandunia to English and Mandarin. Sounds that are in English or Mandarin but not in Pandunia are enclosed in parenthesis.

|            | Pandunia    | English       | Mandarin      |
|------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Nasals     | m n ng      | m n ng        | m n ng        |
| Stops      | p b t d k g | p b t d k g   | p b t d k g   |
| Liquids    | l r y w     | l r y w       | l r y w (yü)  |
| Sibilants  | s z x       | s z sh (zh)   | s z* sh (x)   |
| Fricatives | f h         | f h (v th dh) | f h           |
| Affricates | c j         | ch j          | ch zh (q j c) |

### Regular spelling

English spelling is notoriously irregular. Pīnyīn was created more recently, in the 1950s, but unfortunately it also has some irregularities, simply because there are more sounds in spoken Chinese than there are letters in the Roman alphabet. Still, in comparison to English, Pinyin is very regular. For example the English rhymes _my, sigh, lie,_ and _rye_ would be written in Pīnyīn _mai, sai, lai, rai_. It is as simple as that!

Pandunia can be spelled regularly because it has fewer speech sounds (24) than there are letters in the basic Roman alphabet (26). The alphabet of Pandunia is:  
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p r s t u w x y z

Pandunia has perfect letter-to-sound correspondence. One letter stands for one sound only. One sound is represented by exactly one letter. Every word is pronounced as it is written.

## Easy accent

Texts in Pīnyīn are loaded with accent marks, as in "Wǒmen yě huì shuō zhōngguòhuá." They mark tones. In Standard Chinese each syllable is pronounced in one of the four tones or in the unmarked neutral tone.

English doesn't have word tones but it has word stress. Word stress is variable in English, so the position of stress is unpredictable. In a written expression like "totally fantastic personnel", nothing shows that each word has the stress on a different syllable. If the stress was marked with an accent, it might look something like this: "tótally fantástic personnél".

Tones are hard to learn for people who are not used to them. Variable stress is hard to learn for people who are used to fixed stress. Neither word tone nor variable word stress are necessary in the world language.

Pandunia has fixed stress. The stress falls on the syllable that is before the last consonant. Like this: **mi wól lóga supér dúnia báxe.**

Pandunia doesn't have lexical tone.

## Simple word structure

Mandarin has only a few final consonants: -n, -ng and -r. Other final consonants are foreign and more or less difficult for native Mandarin speakers.

Besides the nasal finals -m, -n and -ng, the liquid finals -l and -r, Pandunia allows voiceless stop finals -p, -t and -k and also sibilants -s and -x.




## International words

Pandunia borrows words from English and Chinese as well as from other languages. Of course, the words are simplified to fit Pandunia's sounds and spelling so that everybody can pronounce them easily.

The basic personal pronouns of Pandunia are: **mi** = I, **tu** = you, **ye** = he, she. They are good examples of how international Pandunia's words can be.

- **mi** is similar to English "me", Spanish "mí" and many other Indo-European languages.
- **tu** is similar to Spanish "tu", French "tu" and Hindi-Urdu "tū" (तू).
- **ye** is similar to Hindi-Urdu "ye" (यह) and to numerous Bantu languages, including Lingala "yé", Swahili "yeye" and Zulu "ye-".

The plural pronouns follow the pattern of Standard Chinese.

| English | Pandunia | Chinese |
|---------|----------|---------|
| I       | mi       | wǒ      |
| you     | tu       | nǐ      |
| he/she  | ye       | tā      |
| we      | mimen    | wǒmen   |
| you     | tumen    | nǐmen   |
| they    | yemen    | tāmen   |

Note: The third person pronoun **ye** refers to both male and female persons as well as inanimate objects – just like the source words in Hindi-Urdu and Bantu languages.

## Easy sentences

The normal sentence word order is subject-verb-object, following the pattern of English and Chinese among others.

    English:   I love you, and you love me.
    Pandunia:  mi ama tu, tu ama mi.
    Chinese:   Wǒ ài nǐ, nǐ ài wǒ. (我爱你，你爱我。)

The verb **bey** is used when the object of an action comes first in the sentence. (This is the so called passive sentence.)

    English:   The apples were eaten.
    Pandunia:  pingo bey kana.
    Chinese:   Píngguǒ bèi chī le. (苹果被吃了。)

**Bey** is a loan word from Standard Chinese, but it is also close to some uses of English "to be".

    English:   It can not be eaten.
    Pandunia:  ye no ken bey kana.
    Chinese:   Tā bù néng bèi chī. (它不能被吃。)

Like Chinese, Pandunia doesn't mark verbs with a word like "to".

    English:   I invite him to drink coffee.
    Pandunia:  mi cing ye kana kafe.
    Chinese:   Wǒ qǐng tā hē kāfēi. (我请他喝咖啡。)

In Pandunia and Chinese, nouns can be singular or plural depending on surrounding words. There's no plural ending like -s in English. Also verbs are not conjugated. One word, **si**, is used instead of _am, is, are, was, were..._

    English:   It is an apple.
    Pandunia:  ye si pingo.
    Chinese:   Tā shì píngguǒ. (他是苹果。)

    English:   They are apples.
    Pandunia:  yemen si pingo.
