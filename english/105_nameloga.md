## Nouns

### Only one form

A noun is a word that names a thing.
Like all words in Pandunia, nouns don't ever change their form.
So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

**sheku**
– a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
**meza**
– a table, tables, the table or the tables  
**kursi**
– a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
**sui**
– water

Number and definiteness are often known because they were previously mentioned in the conversation or because they are general knowledge.
For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **lun** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and moon.


### Indicating number

Pandunia nouns have the same form
in singular (when there is one)
and plural (when there is more than one).
Therefore all Pandunia nouns are like English words
_sheep_, _deer_ and _fish_,
which also have only one form.

A numeral or another quantity word can be added to indicate number
– but usually it's not necessary.
Simply insert a numeral in front of the unchanged noun.

**meme**
– (one or more) sheep  
**un meme**
– a sheep or one sheep  
**du meme**
– two sheep  
**tri meme**
– three sheep  
**ba meme**
– many sheep

**kursi**
– a chair or chairs  
**un kursi**
– one chair  
**du kursi**
– two chairs  
**tri kursi**
– three chairs  
**ba kursi**
– many chairs

An easy way to say that there are many is to repeat the noun two times.

**sheku sheku**
– stones and stones, a variety of stones  
**buke buke**
– books and books, a variety of books


### Proper names

Proper names are nouns for individual people, places and other things.

Names of people can be tagged with the universal title of respect
**shi**.
Using it shows respect and politeness.

It can be used in formal and informal situations and for all age groups, social groups and genders.
The closest translation for it in English is _Mr or Ms_ or _Mx_.

There are different customs concerning honorific titles in different cultures.
In some cultures it is not polite to use someone's name without a title of respect.
Therefore it is advisable to use **shi** always when you meet new people from different cultures.

A title of respect can be used with a given name, a family name, or both.

**shi Bili King**
– Mx Billy King  
**shi Bili**
– Mx Billy  
**shi King**
– Mx King


### Compound words

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word.
The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound,
and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

**sol foto**
– sun light  
**luna foto**
– moon light  
**luna sheku**
– moon stone
