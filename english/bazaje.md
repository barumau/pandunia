# Commonalities in the Pandunia varieties

## Introduction

The structure words are in common to every variety of Pandunia.
Structure words are easy to recognize because they consist of only one syllable,
which is made up of one consonant and one vowel.
Other Pandunia words consist of more and/or longer syllables.

Structure words help to organize words into structurally complete and meaningful sentences.

The common parts of Pandunia are presented in this section
by using only structure words and a handful of content words.
Only the following content words are used in this section:

**jen**
– person  
**mau**
– cat

## Summary

_Function words_ are words that help to structure other words into more or less complex sentences.
It is a _closed class_ of words, so new words can never be added to it.
_Content words_, on the other hand, is an open, ever-growing class of words,
and they refer to things in the world outside the structure of the language.
Function words have only a structural role
and therefore they behave differently than content words.

In Pandunia, the pronouns and other function words that are derived from them have the following characteristics:

1. The word is made up of one consonant and one vowel.
2. The consonant indicates the general idea of the word.
   Sometimes the same consonant is used for expressing two different ideas.
3. The vowel has a structural meaning, as follows:
    - **-e** indicates a pronoun
    - **-i** indicates a possessive pronoun
    - **-o** indicates an adverb of manner
    - **-a** indicates a preposition
    - **-u** indicates a postposition
    - **-ə** indicates a determiner of definiteness, indefiniteness, etc.
