# The basics of Pandunia

Pandunia is a constructed language that has a minimalistic grammar and a globalistic vocabulary.

### Letters and sounds

Pandunia uses a systematic spelling where
each letter represents one spoken sound.

The vowels **a, e, i, o, u** are pronounced as in "are there three or two".

The consonants are:
**b**,
**c** (sounds like _ch_ in _church_),
**d**,
**f**,
**g** (always hard),
**h**,
**j**,
**k**,
**l**,
**m**,
**n**,
**p**,
**r** (never silent),
**s** (always voiceless),
**t**,
**v** (sounds like _w_),
**x** (sounds like _sh_),
**y**,
**z**.

### Never changing words

Words don't ever inflect or change in Pandunia
– not even when they change their word class!
The same word, without any change in form, can serve as a noun, adjective or verb.

### Personal pronouns

|                   |              |
|:-----------------:|:------------:|
| **mi**            | **mimon**    |
| _I, me_           | _we, us_     |
| **tu**            | **tumon**    |
| _you_             | _you all_    |
| **ye**            | **yemon**    |
| _he/she, him/her_ | _they, them_ |

### Basic sentence structures

The particle **ya** 'yes' separates the subject and the verb.

**mau ya yam.**
– The cat eats.  
**jen ya some.**
– The person sleeps.

If the subject is a personal pronoun, the **ya** is left out.

**mi yam.**
– I eat.  
**tu some.**
– You sleep.

The basic word order is subject–verb–object
– the same as in English!

**mi ame tu.**
– I love you.

When the direct object is a noun, it is marked apart from the verb by a demonstrative pronoun, numeral or another determiner.

**mi yam un pai.**
– I eat a pie.  
**tu yam ni pai.**
– You eat this pie.

### Negation

To negate a word, add **no** before it.

**mi no some.**
– I don't sleep.  
**tu yam no jen.**
– You eat no-one.

### To be

The verb **si** means 'to be'.
It can be left out in very simple sentences.

**mi un jen.**
– I'm a person.  
**mi si un jen.**
– I am a person.  
**mi vol si un mau.**
– I want to be a cat.

### Multi-purpose words

Pandunia words can be ambiguous because they often have more meanings compared to English.

**ye ame mau.**
– He loves cats. / She loved a cat. / He or she will love the cat.

But actually the meaning is clear in the real context:

**pre tri nen, mi ha du mau e un vaf. mi max ha un fem ben. ye ame mau!**
– Three years ago, I had two cats and a dog. I also had a daughter. _She loved the cats!_

### Time

Tenses and aspects are optionally expressed with the help of adverbs and auxiliary verbs, like
**zai**
(currently),
**pas**
(in the past),
**le**
(already), and
**xa**
(in the future).

**mi zai ame tu.**
– I am loving you.  
**mi pas ame tu.**
– I loved you.  
**mi le ame tu.**
– I have loved you.  
**mi xa ame tu.**
– I will love you.

### Passive

The passive voice is formed with the help of the helping verb
**be**.

**tu be ame.**
– You are loved.  
**mi be ame de tu.**
– I am loved by you.

### Modifying other words

To modify a noun, put adjectives before it.

**un nove ame**
– a new love  
**la bon pai**
– the good pie

To modify a verb, put adverbs before it.
The adverb can be tagged with **di**.

**mi bon vide tu.**
– I see you well.  
**tu vide di ame ye.**
– You seemingly love him/her.

Modifiers are compared with
**max** 'more, -er', **maxim** 'most, -est',
**min** 'less', **minim** 'least' and **par** 'equally, as'.
The point of comparison is introduced with **ka** 'than, as'.

**tu si max lau ka mi.**
– You are older than me.  
**tu si maxim lau.**
– You are the oldest.

### Questions

To ask _yes–or–no_ questions, replace the verb with "(verb) **no** (verb)" pattern or add **he** 'eh, huh' to the end of the sentence.

**tu vide no vide mi?**
– Do you see me?  
**tu vide mi, he?**
– You see me, eh?

To ask a content question, write a normal sentence and replace the word in question with
**ke**
'what, who'.

**tu ame ke?**
– Who do you love?  
**tu ame ke man?**
– Which man do you love?  
**ke man ya ame tu?**
– Which man loves you?  
**tu ame ye ke poli?**
– How much do you love him?

### Commands

To state a command, leave out the subject and start the sentence with the verb.

**yam ni pai!**
– Eat this pie!  
**vide go mau!**
– Look at that cat!
