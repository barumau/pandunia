# Phrases in isolating Pandunia

### Grammar

All the phrases in this page follow these three rules:

1. Head-last: The first word or phrase modifies the next one.
2. Noun phrase boundary: A pause or a determiner (i.e. a numeral, a possessive pronoun or a demonstrative pronoun) begins a new noun phrase.
3. Zero be: There is a "zero be" i.e. an equality sign (=) between two consecutive noun phrases.

### Method of Presentation

1. The phrase in Pandunia **in bold letters**.
