# Instructions for translating this site

## Dictionary

The original dictionary is a file called
[pandunia-loge.csv](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/blob/master/pandunia-loge.csv).
It is in character-separated format (CSV) and the cell separator is the vertical bar "|".
It includes translations to english and many other languages.
All dictionaries in different languages are created from this file.

You can edit the file in Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, other spreadsheet tools and text editors.


## Downloading source texts

Most of the textual contents of this website are stored in a version control system that is hosted by GitHub in [here](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia). The system maintains [change history](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/commits/master), [list of contributors](https://github.com/barumau/pandunia/graphs/contributors) and other things. You can get started with GitHub by reading their [guides](https://guides.github.com/).

GitHub offers two ways to download the contents of the version repository. Click the button that reads "Clone or download".

1. You can download it as a ZIP file.
    * In this case you can send the files that you have updated by email to risto@pandunia.info
2. If you are used to programming, you can clone the repository with Git.
    * In this case you can create a _pull request_ in GitHub.

## Writing in Markdown syntax

Contents of Pandunia website is written in plain-text using Markdown format. Markdown is a light-weight and easy-to-use syntax that is perfectly readable in plain-text. Read description of the Markdown syntax [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Preview changes locally

Pandunia website uses Markdown-based content management system called [Up](http://twisty.org/post/up) for displaying the contents. You don't need to install it locally.

Instead you can use [MDwiki](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/). Just copy mdwiki.html to the same folder where pandunia texts are (index.md, navigation.md and the rest), double-click mdwiki.html to open it in your browser and you're ready!

## Translating

### Source language

English version is the original version of the site. Translate to your language from the English version if possible! Otherwise use another language that is up-to-date and complete.

### What to translate first?

When you begin translating for a new language, start from these files.

* index.md
    * This page should include a short introduction to Pandunia.
    * Include here links only to pages that are existing and/or ready.
    * If the site is incomplete, ask the reader to go to a more complete language version (like English)
* navigation.md
    * This is the top menu of the site
    * Include here links only to pages that are existing and/or ready.
* abc.md
    * This page explains how to pronounce Pandunia
* fraze.md
    * This page introduces basic words, sentences and grammatical structures
* kanun.md
    * This is the grammar page
    * Translate at least the chapter called _Basic Rules_

### Translating entire documents

1. Copy the source file to the folder of the new language
    * Keep the original name! Names are in Pandunia so that contents of different language versions can be compared more easily.
2. Translate text
3. If translation is incomplete in the end
    * Delete untranslated text
    * or hide it between < ! - - and - - > (without spaces) so that it won't be visible in the web site

### Updating translations

The best way to update translations and to translate parts of documents is to use a program that compares two files side by side. A good tool for this is BeyondCompare.

Pandunia words and sentences should be the same in both language versions, so they function as anchor points that keep the versions in the same line.

### Tips

* Use simple and concise language
    * Readers can be all ages and they can have any level of education.
    * Certain languages are read by many non-native speakers too.
* Use original examples in Pandunia. This way it's easy to compare versions.
* Use fluent language
    * If something sounds bad in your language when it is translated from English (or another language), just change it to something better!
* You can improve also the source text.
    * The source text is not perfect. There can be unclear things, improper style and even mistakes.
    * It is even OK to propose new chapters and lessons
