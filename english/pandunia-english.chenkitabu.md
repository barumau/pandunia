# Panduniaâ€“English word list

This word list consists of words in Pandunia and their translations to English.
The list is arranged in the alphabetical order by Pandunia base words.

Each dictionary entry consists of a word or compound word in Pandunia and its translation to English.
There is only one translation
when the meaning of the word and the meaning of its English translation are almost or completely the same.

> aple - apple  
> arane - spider

When the Pandunia word can be translated in more than one way,
the most common translation is first
and it is followed by more specific translations inside parenthesis.

> chira - tear (rip, split)

If there is more than one meaning,
they are separated by the semicolon.

> ching - ask (request, beg, plead; please)

Sometimes there are two entries of the same word.

> **huru** - free (unbound)  
> **fa huru** - free (liberate)

The entry with **fa** is there only for including the verbal translation in English.
Pandunia words are multipurpose words that can be used as verbs, adjectives, nouns and adverbs.
Therefore it is normally enough to use only the main word of the dictionary entry in sentence contexts
and the auxiliary verb **fa** can be left out.
For example, **mi huru yemon** is the proper way to say 'I free them' or 'I liberate them'.
The sentence **mi fa huru yemon** would mean the same thing but it would include the superfluous word **fa**.
