# Pandunia–English dictionary

This dictionary consists of words in Pandunia and their translations to English.
The list is arranged in the alphabetical order by Pandunia base words.

Each dictionary entry consists of a word or compound word in Pandunia and its translation to English.
There is only one translation
when the meanings of the word and its English translation are almost or completely the same.

> **aplə** - apple  
> **aranə** - spider

When the Pandunia word can be translated in more than one way,
the most common translation is first
and it is followed by more specific translations inside parenthesis.

> **chirə** - tear (rip, split)

If there is more than one meaning,
they are separated by the semicolon.

> **ching** - ask (request, beg, plead; please)  
> **hurə** - free (unbound; liberate)  

Most Pandunia words carry the multipurpose ending **-ə**.
It can be easily changed to another ending as needed.

#### Example 1. *logə*

The following is an actual entry from the dictionary.

> **logə** - say (speak, talk; speech, words)

It serves as the basis for other words,
which are listed below
and which are not included in this dictionary.

> **loga** - to talk, to speak  
> **logu** - to talk, to speak  
> **loge** - words, speech  
> **logi** - spoken, oral  
> **logo** - by speech, orally

#### Example 2. *luna*

Some word stems end in a full vowel.
Here is one example.

> **luna** - moon (lunar)

It serves as the basis for the following list of additional word forms,
which are not included in this dictionary.

> **luna'** - moon  
> **luna'i** - lunar

The apostrophe is there to indicate that the vowel is part of the word stem
and not a word class marker.

#### Example 3. *mi*

This dictionary includes also some frequently used words
that include a dedicated word class marker
other than the multipurpose ending **-ə**.

> **me** - I  
> **mi** - my
