# Verbs

Verbs are unchanging in Pandunia.
Things like person, number, time and mood are indicated by separate words,
not by changing the form of verbs as in English and other languages.

## Person and number

Person and number are indicated by the subject.
For example, the verb
**es**
('to be') has the same form in all persons.

**mi es doste.**
– I am a friend.  
**tu es doste.**
– You are a friend.  
**ho es doste.**
– He/she is a friend.  
**mimen es doste.**
– We are friends.  
**tumen es doste.**
– You are friends.  
**homen es doste.**
– They are friends.

Also a noun can serve as subject.

**mau es hevan.**
– The cat is an animal.


## Voice, time and mood

Verb tenses, moods and voices are expressed with auxiliary verbs,
which come first in the verb phrase.
The order of the auxiliaries is tense, mood and aspect.
The tense marker is first, the mood marker is next, and the aspect marker is last.

### Tense

Tense is a property that expresses time reference.
The main tenses are the past, present, and future.
The marker
**le**
indicates the past tense,
**nun**
indicates the present tense, and
**fu**
indicates the future tense.
More specific time references are expressed with various time expressions, like *yesterday*, *tomorrow* or *one hour ago*.

*man* ***le*** *yam ban.*
– The man *ate* (or *did eat*) bread.  
*man* ***nun*** *yam ban.*
– The man *eats* bread (now).  
*man* ***fu*** *yam ban.*
– The man *will eat* bread.

It is also possible to express the future in the past
with a combination of two tense markers.

**man** ***le fu*** **yam ban.**
– The man *was going to* eat bread.


### Aspect

Aspect expresses how an action or event extends over time.
There are two aspect markers in Pandunia,
**sta** and **ha**.

The marker
**sta**
indicates that the action or event is *on-going* or *in progress*
at the time, which the speaker is talking about.
The time can be indicated with a tense marker.

**man** ***sta*** **yam ban.**
– The man *is*, *was* or *will be* eating bread.  
**man** ***le sta*** **yam ban.**
– The man was eating bread.  
**man** ***nun sta*** **yam ban.**
– The man is eating bread.  
**man** ***fu sta*** **yam ban.**
– The man will be eating bread.

The marker
**ha**
indicates that the action or event is completed
and its results still has an effect at the time, which the speaker is talking about.
The time can be indicated with a tense markers.

**man** ***ha*** **yam ban.**
– The man *had*, *has* or *will have* eaten bread.  
**man** ***le ha*** **yam ban.**
– The man had eaten bread.  
**man** ***nun ha*** **yam ban.**
– The man has eaten bread.  
**man** ***fu ha*** **yam ban.**
– The man will have eaten bread.


### Mood

The conditional mood is used for anything that could take place.
It indicates that the realization of an action or event depends on another condition.
The conditional mood is expressed with the auxiliary verb
**vud**
('would').
This marker is used in both main and subordinate clauses.

**mi** ***vud*** **voli yam.**
– I *would* like to eat.  
**mi** ***vud*** **go do Dubai.**
– I *would* go to Dubai.  
**mi** ***vud*** **go, if tu vud las mi.**
– I *would* go if you would let me.  
**tu no** ***vud*** **es suka, if mi** ***vud*** **go.**
– You would not be happy, if I would go.

The auxiliary verb
**debe**
('should, ought') indicates some kind of expectation like duty, obligation, requirement, desire, advisability or likelihood.

**ma voka mimen. mimen debe go.**
– Mother called us. We should go.  
**ho debe ha kom pre nun.**
– He should have come by now.  
**evri von debe vote.**
– Everyone should vote.

The imperative mood is used to form a command or request.
In Pandunia, the imperative is created with the auxiliary verb
**shal**.
It can be used to give commands to any person, not just "you".

**mimen shal go!**
– Let us go! ~ Let's go!  
**homen shal kurse!**
– Let them run!

**shal**
can be used to give commands also to the second person,
but it is common to drop both the personal pronoun and the auxiliary verb
in order to give the command more force.

**tu shal kom!** = **kom!**
– Come!  
**tumen shal kom!** = **kom!**
– Come (you all)!

### Passive clause

The passive clause expresses that the subject undergoes the action or has its state changed.
In other words, the subject has a passive role.
This contrasts with the active clause where the subject is the agent or the doer of the action.
In Pandunia, the passive clause is constructed with the help of the auxiliary verb
**sta**.

Active:
**homen yam piza.**
– They eat pizza.  
Passive:
**piza bi yam.**
– Pizza is eaten.

The agent of the action can be expressed also in passive clauses by using the preposition
**da**.

**mi di gar le bi bate da tren.**
– My car was hit by a train.

The equivalent of passive (past) participle is built by using the prefix
**bi**-
and the suffix
-**(t)ik**.

**biyamik piza**
– eaten pizza (pizza that was or is eaten)  
**bilogutik lexe**
– spoken word (word that was or is spoken)

## Transitivity

In general, there are three types of verbs.

1. Transitive verbs need a direct object, which is the target of the action.
2. Intransitive verbs don't accept an object. Then the action is directed to the subject.
3. Ambitransitive verbs can be both transitive and intransitive.

Pandunia verbs are typically ambitransitive
i.e. they may or may not require an object depending on the sentence structure.
When there is an object, the verb is transtive,
and when there isn't an object, the verb is intransitive.

**mi bule sui.**
– I boil water. (transitive sentence)  
**sui bule.**
– Water boils. (intransitive sentence)  
**baker bake ban.**
– The baker bakes bread. (transitive sentence)  
**ban bake in tanur.**
– Bread bakes in the oven. (intransitive sentence)


## Serial verb construction

Serial verb construction is a string of verbs that share the same subject,
which is before the verbs.
In serial verb constructions the verbs are interpreted so that
the first verb (an auxiliary verb) is something that the subject possesses
and the second verb is something that the subject does (when there is an object in the end)
or experiences (when there is no object).

**mi pote kitab el javab.**  
≈ *I have the ability to write the answer.*  
– I can write the answer.  
**mi halal kitab el javab.**  
≈ *I have the permission to write the answer.*  
– I may write the answer.  
**mi mus kitab el javab.**  
≈ *I have the compulsion to write the answer.*  
– I must write the answer.

Note that the same auxiliary verbs can be used alone as transitive verbs in the pivot construction.

**guru halal mi kitab el javab.**
– The teacher permits me to write the answer.  
**guru mus mi kitab el javab.**
– The teacher compels me to write the answer.
