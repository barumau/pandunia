## Grammar

As you can see from the dialog, Pandunia is an easy language to learn.
It's easy to begin learning it if you already speak English.
(And you do, because you are reading this in English.)
But it's still easy even if you don't speak any English
because Pandunia is totally regular.

### Personal pronouns

Here are the personal pronouns in Pandunia:

| Singular                   | Plural                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **mi** – _I_               | **mimen** – _we_           |
| **tu** – _you_             | **tumen** – _you all_      |
| **ho** – _he or she_       | **homen** – _they_         |

The personal pronouns, like all words in Pandunia, never change.
The same word form is used as the subject (i.e. the "doer") and as the object.
So there aren't separate word forms like "I" and "me" or "we" and "us".

**mi mete tu.**
– I meet you.  
**tu mete mi.**
– You meet me.  
**mimen mete homen.**
– We meet them.

### Possessive pronouns

The possessive pronouns (_my_, _your_, etc.) are created regularly by adding the possessive marker
**di**.

| Singular                   | Plural                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **mi di** – _my_           | **mimen di** – _our_       |
| **tu di** – _your_         | **tumen di** – _your_      |
| **ho di** – _his or her_   | **homen di** – _their_     |

### The same verb in all persons

The verb for being is also regular and it's the same for all persons.

**mi es**
– I am  
**tu es**
– you are (thou art)  
**ho es**
– he or she is  
**mimen es**
– we are  
**tumen es**
– you are  
**homen es**
– they are

So verbs don't change to indicate the person.
And nouns don't change either!
The word **nam**, in the same single form, can refer to one name or many names.

**ho di nam es Mari.**
– Her name is Mari.  
**ho di nam es Yusef.**
– His name is Yusef.  
**homen di nam es Mari e Yusef.**
– Their names are Mari and Yusef.

Pandunia is free from all sorts of inflection, declination, conjugation or whatever it's called.
Words don't change, period.
It's as simple as that!
